Direction of the Evolution of Each Business\n\u2022 The launch of PlayStation\u00ae5, scheduled for the holiday season of this calendar year, will deliver even more immersive experiences on a game console. Higher speed, enhanced sensory perceptions generated by its revolutionary controller, and sound delivered in 3D audio will combine to realize truly next generation console game experiences unlike anything before.\n\u2022 The PlayStation\u2122 Now cloud streaming game service and Remote Play functionality enable users to enjoy a seamless gaming experience anytime, anywhere.\n\u2022 Music is a business that is expected to grow steadily due to the strengthening of the music publishing business through the acquisition of EMI Music Publishing and the growth of the streaming market.\n\u2022 The Sony Music Group, which combines recorded music and music publishing, was established in August last year. With a vision to become the most talent-friendly music company, the label and publishing teams are working together to support artists from all directions.\n\u2022 In the Japanese music business, which has created hits in diverse areas of IP such as music, anime and character merchandising, artist management is an area of augmentation.\n\u2022 At a time when new DTC services are continuing to be introduced across the industry and demand for content is ever-increasing, Sony Pictures Entertainment is investing in the development of owned IP as well as strengthening its creative capacity, and continues to produce outstanding video entertainment across diverse genres.\n\u2022 At the same time, Sony will continue to closely monitor the impact of the spread of COVID-19 on the consumption of video content going forward, working with the creative community and our supply chain partners including exhibitors towards resuming content releases.\n\u2022 Sony intends to engage in Group-wide efforts to deliver Japanese anime to audiences around the world through its anime DTC services.\n\u2022 In digital entertainment in China, where further growth is expected, Sony will strengthen its relations with local companies in areas such as anime, games and music.\n\u2022 None Animation is not classified as a segment in Sony's financial disclosure, and is included in the Game & Network Services, Music and Pictures segments.\n\u2022 By continuing to introduce products and services that deliver reality and real-time through sound, video and communication technologies, Sony will aim to address the increasing need for remote solutions that connect people with people and people to things remotely.\n\u2022 In the medical business, Sony will reinforce its efforts to contribute to the health of people over the long term by leveraging the imaging, display and mechatronics technologies it has cultivated over many years.\n\u2022 In light of the impact of COVID-19 on product demand and supply chains, Sony will engage in initiatives to enhance its structure in response to these changes in its environment.\n\u2022 Due to the uncertain market environment, Sony is carefully reviewing its capital expenditure plans in this segment in relation to projected demand through the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022, but its goals of maintaining the global number one position in imaging and gaining the global number one position in sensing remain unchanged.\n\u2022 Sony is also strengthening its focus on sensing solutions for mobile devices that \"connect people to people,\" and automotive sensing solutions that \"support people,\" which are expected to grow over the long term.\n\u2022 Based on its belief that image sensors will be key devices in the AI era, Sony intends to leverage its world-leading stacked CMOS image sensor technology and provide AI sensing solutions that deliver new value across a broad range of applications.\n\u2022 Under the new SFH management team, initiatives will include measures to further increase the value generated by the \"Lifeplanner\" sales employees who constitute the core value of the life insurance business.\n\u2022 The Company will also explore further opportunities for synergies including leveraging Sony's technology in the Financial Services business.\n\n4. Contribution to \"People,\" \"Society,\" and the \"Planet\"\n\u2022 Sony's social mission is to create and deliver emotion.
