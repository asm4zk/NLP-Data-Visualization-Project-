   "content": "Seki: Today we\u2019ll take a closer look at the spirit of Sony Design and why these products appeal to people. To begin, Yutaka and Thomas will tell us a little about their favorite Sony products.\n\nHasegawa: The product I chose is called the \u201cSkysensor\u201d ICF-5800, which my father bought for me. It was this series that introduced the new experience of listening to shortwave broadcasts from Japan and around the world. The designers must have thought carefully about how to bring the sophistication of professional equipment to the average user. In all respects \u2013 from how the radio feels to its usability \u2013 it\u2019s well designed.\n\n We get the same impression from the user manual, which depicts cockpit instrumentation on the front. Here, too, we\u2019re invited to enjoy a new user experience. This approach to design is still very much with us at Sony today, and when we create a new kind of product, we\u2019re also very careful to arrange a fitting new user experience.\n\nSeki: The nature of this experience has no doubt changed a lot as digital products gradually replaced the Skysensor and other analog products. How has Sony ensured a consistent user experience?\n\nHasegawa: We closely consider the user perspective when creating new experiences, so that the design resonates with people. But of course some products are completely different from others. Products designed for a premium listening experience are quite unlike others designed for enjoying sports or fitness, such as a tennis sensor. That\u2019s why, instead of imposing the same design language on all products, we must apply in-depth knowledge of users from one era to the next, so that products take shape in fitting ways.\n\nSeki: So products are always designed from an intimate awareness of user needs, from one generation to another.\n\nHasegawa: That\u2019s right. Rather than limiting ourselves to the shapes and forms of the past, we prefer to keep offering fresh user experiences."
