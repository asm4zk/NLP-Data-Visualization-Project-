   "content": "The only goal of the Signature Series is delivering Sony's vision of the ultimate in sound quality. With that objective square in their sights, engineers and designers have forged collaborative connections on every development project\u2014working together right out of the gate. Those efforts have transcended the traditional frameworks of cost, material, and structure in search of sound experiences that immerse listeners in what the artists behind the sounds intended people to hear and make users feel present in the music. The team's first models, which came out in 2016, wowed audiophiles the world over with their in-the-moment sound\u2014what many likened to being right there in a concert hall.\n\nThe development team, aiming to take sound quality to a deeper level, focused on bringing the joys of the ultimate-audio experience to an even broader user base. Embracing their tireless pursuit of what audio can be, the developers set off to create a digital music player that would maximize the potential of any headphone unit and a set of in-ear headphones that would make the ultimate sound experience mobile. The designers grounded their perspective in a solid understanding of the technology, using their design sensibilities to piece together mechanisms and shapes capable of unleashing incredible sound quality. It also meant translating the Signature Series design concept into an intuitive look: a visual rendering of pure aural magic, with the forms maximizing the unique elements of each model and eliminating any non-essential decorative features.\n\nLearn more about the existing models here >"
