   "content": "Behind the X94/93D Series\u2019 outstanding 4K HDR picture quality lie two slate-like layers designed to bring the very best out of every image: a beautiful surface screen and our new Slim Backlight Drive\u21223, seemingly divided by a line with a brassy sheen that runs down the sides of the TV. The sleek, flat bezel creates a visual link between all sides, framing and emphasizing the ultra-slim nature of the TV.\n\nOur commitment to beautiful design flows through every aspect of this TV \u2013 including the stands. The X94/93D Series boasts an elegant, tapered front plate that lifts and angles the TV to create a sense of lightness while also ensuring stability. Finished in aluminum, the warm silver tone of the stand perfectly complements both the TV and your living space.\n\nYou can also mount it on a wall, where the TV\u2019s specially engineered rear vent and bracket enable it to look as well integrated as a window within your living room.4"
