   "content": "REDWOOD CITY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Respawn Entertainment, a studio of Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ:EA), today announced that Apex Legends Season 5 - Fortune\u2019s Favor has quickly become the best start of any season to date. More new players are coming into the game and along with returning fans, it has driven the highest player retention for a season launch, with players playing for longer periods of time per day than ever before.\n\nAs new aspects of the game\u2019s story unfold in Season 5, the community\u2019s connection to the lore and Legends is growing stronger as well. Apex Legends Season 5 trailers earned more than 47M views to date, the most ever for Apex Legends season launch trailers. Fortune\u2019s Favor has also sparked the Apex Legends community to create UGC that has driven more than 176M views in the first two weeks, the most two week UGC views for any season launch to date.\n\n\u201cBringing more of the Apex Legends story and experience to life for our fans is the thrill of working on this game, and Season 5 is no exception,\u201d said Chad Grenier, Game Director. \u201cThis season we wiped out Skull Town, which really allowed us to have some fun and do something unexpected. We\u2019re happy to see that players, both new and returning, are really enjoying it.\u201d\n\nApex Legends sets itself apart from other battle royale games through its lore and its Legends. Respawn continues to inject fresh storylines and content into each season. From online and in-game teases to the \u201cStories from the Outlands\u201d trailers and all-new Quests in Season 5, the development team based in Los Angeles and Vancouver seeks to deliver something truly unique and pushes themselves to try something new as they evolve the game\u2019s narrative.\n\nWinner of the Best Multiplayer Game Awards of 2019 from The Game Awards, BAFTA and more, Apex Legends delivers a squad-based Battle Royale experience where players select from one of 13 Legends \u2013 each with their own unique abilities and playstyles \u2013 and the last team standing wins. Combatants can choose from unique characters like Loba, a high society thief who uses her new teleportation bracelet to obtain the most secure and unattainable items within her reach, or Pathfinder, a MRVN (Mobile Robotic Versatile eNtity) modified to specialize in location scouting and surveying. Balanced squads and teamwork are critical, as each Legend is easy to pick up and learn but challenging to master.\n\nTo learn more about Apex Legends, follow the game on Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram.\n\nElectronic Arts (NASDAQ: EA) is a global leader in digital interactive entertainment. The Company develops and delivers games, content and online services for Internet-connected consoles, mobile devices and personal computers.\n\nIn fiscal year 2020, EA posted GAAP net revenue of $5.5 billion.
