   "content": "The Slice of Living concept takes elements and manners that have always been part of the \u201cliving room\u201d ideal and reconstructs them in new ways to create product that harmonize naturally with their surroundings. We wanted to get to the heart of that central essence. We wanted to push the TV aesthetic beyond the traditional realms of furniture and interior design. What we came up with was the One Slate concept\u2014an approach that condenses a given product into a single slate, giving the product a natural elegance for users to experience as a work of art in and of itself. The standard protocols of TV design no longer applied. To create a design capable of transforming living spaces, we knew what it had to do: shape the TV into a work of art.\n\n* In cases of sold in Americas, called A1E series."
