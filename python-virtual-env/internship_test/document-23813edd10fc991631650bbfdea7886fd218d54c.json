   "content": "REDWOOD CITY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--It\u2019s time to get to work in The Sims\u2122 4. Today, Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ:EA) announced that The Sims 4 Get to Work* is now available on PC and Mac in North America. In this first expansion pack for The Sims 4, players can deepen their relationships with their Sims by actively controlling them in three new careers (Doctor, Detective and Scientist) as well as creating and customizing their own Sim retail business.\n\nIn the three all-new careers, players will actively control their Sims\u2019 decisions throughout the workday. They will meet fellow co-workers, explore the new career venues and decide whether to work toward that next promotion or wreak havoc on the workplace.\n\nStart saving lives as a Doctor \u2013 take your Sims to work at the Hospital to examine patients, run x-rays, make diagnoses, perform surgeries and even deliver babies. Doctors will also make house calls to visit sick Sims. Sims can become sick through close interactions with other ill Sims and find relief by ordering medication.\n\nSolve crimes as a Detective \u2013 your Sims will start their days at the Police Station to pick up new cases. Then they\u2019ll be dispatched to crime scenes where they will gather evidence, track clues and collect witness statements in order to identify suspects and make arrests. Back at the Police Station they can search suspects, take their mug shots and fingerprints; even interrogate them in hopes of a confession. Sims in the Detective career can also patrol the streets and issue tickets to neighborhood menaces.\n\nClimb the inventive heights as a Scientist \u2013 develop your Sims\u2019 analytical mastermind to craft diabolical creations such as the Cloning Machine or the SimRay, which gives Scientists the ability to freeze other Sims, control their minds and transform objects. Scientist Sims can also create the ElectroFlux Wormhole Generator to whisk themselves away to Sixam, the mysterious home world of fan-favorite Aliens, who make a much anticipated return to The Sims 4.\n\nIn addition, players can run their own retail business by purchasing or creating a retail location, designing the store front and selecting what items to sell. Players can set prices, hire and manage employees, customize uniforms and work to make the final sale. From clothing boutiques to art galleries, or bakeries to bookstores, there is no limit to the type of retail business that can be created. Also new are the Photography and Baking skills that give Sims new things to learn, new things to do and achieve and new creations to sell.\n\nThe Sims 4 Get to Work is rated \u2018T\u2019 for Teen by the ESRB and available on PC and Mac for $39.99 at various retail stores and for digital download.
