   "content": "The BRAVIA lineup has a legacy of delivering amazing visual experiences with the living environment in mind. Aiming to embody a \u201cSlice of Living,\u201d which formed the series\u2019 guiding design philosophy, BRAVIA devices have incorporated elements of living spaces in hopes of striking a harmonious chord with interior settings. In exploring ways to attain that ideal, the development team eventually crafted products that fused picture and sound into a single slate: the A1 Series of 4K OLED TVs, a testament to the power of realism and simplicity. From that point onward, Sony wove the Sound-from-Picture Reality experience into a host of other models across the product landscape.\n\nDesign philosophies evolve, though, and the BRAVIA design approach is embarking in a new direction for the future. While video-streaming services continue to make technological strides and render the world\u2019s video content in even more astounding clarity, delivering compatibility with 4K and even 8K resolutions, Sony\u2019s accelerating advances on both the visual and sound sides are unlocking doors to new levels of immersion through picture and sound in perfect harmony. The content is better than ever before. So is the technology. So are the viewing environments. With that context shaping the future of the viewing experience, Sony\u2019s team of designers aligned their focus with thetheme of the \u201cImmersive Edge.\u201d The name encapsulates the process: enhancing immersion through an edge-oriented aesthetic. By minimizing the \u201cvisual noise\u201d that the TV\u2019s bezel and stand can create, thereby leaving nothing but thin \u201cedges\u201d separating content from real space, the design theme serves to streamline the look of the product and give the immersive dimension of image-sound integration room to shine\u2014uninhibited by extraneous features. The physical presence of the TV itself recedes into the background, while the content reaches its full potential in the foreground."
