   "content": "Actually, very little of my discussion with Inoue was about how clothing looks. Rather, we talked quite a bit about how to discover natural materials, how to develop them, and how to present them to the people of the world. Instead of starting with an idea of something to make, it\u2019s more about fully utilizing the qualities of things that already exist and maximizing their value. Expressed in terms of cooking, it's like putting together a menu with seasonal ingredients when you harvest them, then calling your friends over to enjoy a meal. His design is about asking how to take the incredible natural beauty that he finds and share it with everyone just the way it is. I found it reminiscent of the way we at Sony think about how to use our design capabilities to take new technologies that we have in-house and release them to the world.\n\nThis experience made me rethink what workmanship actually is. The job of a designer is to sort out various issues such as how to make things user-friendly and how to produce them, then get them into people's hands. However, this conversation with Inoue reminded me that designers also have a \"core\" element that must be unwavering. Designers are responsible for pursuing the ultimate inputs and expressions, whatever the situation. If your workmanship does not add anything to the lives of the people you reach, it has no meaning."
