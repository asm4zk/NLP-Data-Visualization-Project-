Learnings from this period will forever change the way we work at EA.\u201d\n\u2022 Digital net bookings* for the fiscal year was $4.052 billion, up 9% year-over-year and now represents 78% of total net bookings.\n\u2022 FIFA 20 has more than 25 million unique players to date.\n\u2022 Apex LegendsTM was the most downloaded free-to-play game on PS4 in calendar 2019.\n\u2022 Star Wars Jedi: Fallen OrderTM has more than 10 million unique players to date.\n\u2022 In every quarter of fiscal 2020, monthly average players in The Sims 4TM were higher than the comparable period in the prior year.\n\n* Net bookings is defined as the net amount of products and services sold digitally or sold-in physically in the period. Net bookings is calculated by adding total net revenue to the change in deferred net revenue for online-enabled games and mobile platform fees.\n\nAll financial measures are presented on a GAAP basis.\n\u2022 Net cash from operating activities was $498 million for the quarter and $1.797 billion for the fiscal year.\n\u2022 EA repurchased 2.7 million shares for $291 million during the quarter, bringing the total for the last twelve months to 12.3 million shares for $1.207 billion.\n\nThe following GAAP-based financial data and tax rate of 18% was used internally by company management to adjust its GAAP results in order to assess EA\u2019s operating results:\n\nFor more information about the nature of the GAAP-based financial data, please refer to EA\u2019s Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2019.\n\nThe following GAAP-based financial data and tax rate of 18% was used internally by company management to adjust its GAAP results in order to assess EA\u2019s operating results:\n\nFor more information about the nature of the GAAP-based financial data, please refer to EA\u2019s Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2019.\n\nThe following is a calculation of our total net bookings for the periods presented:\n\nImpact of COVID-19 on our Business Operations and Outlook\n\nWe have focused on actions to support our people, our players, and our communities around the world affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Substantially all of our global workforce has shifted to work from home, and our primary focus continues to be the safety and well-being of our employees. Our IT, security and digital platform teams mobilized to add capacity to our remote working systems to scale to a fully distributed workforce.\n\nThroughout this time, our studio teams have continued to deliver live service content while working from home. We launched our \u201cStay Home, Play Together\u201d initiative to bring our players together when physical distancing is keeping us apart, and we\u2019ve delivered dozens of Stay & Play programs to date, from special community livestreams and giveaways, to athletes and celebrities playing our games with fans. Our esports teams have conducted major online tournaments, and we\u2019ve executed or plan to execute in the coming months more than 100 celebrity, athlete, community and charity online esports events.\n\nWith more people staying at home, we have experienced, and are continuing to experience, heightened levels of engagement and live services net bookings growth to date. The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to predict. The key risks to EA\u2019s business are set forth under the heading \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d in this release.\n\nBusiness Outlook as of May 5, 2020\n\nThe following forward-looking statements reflect expectations as of May 5, 2020. Electronic Arts assumes no obligation to update these statements. Results may be materially different and are affected by many factors detailed in this release and in EA\u2019s annual and quarterly SEC filings.\n\nBeginning in fiscal year 2021, we will make two changes to the way we report net bookings.\n\u2022 First, we will report mobile bookings gross of platform fees, instead of net, to align with industry practice. This will result in a gross up in net bookings but no change to underlying profit.\n\u2022 Second, we will update the presentation of net bookings by composition to focus on full game and live services sales & other, in line with the direction we continue to drive the business.\n\nOur fiscal year 2021 guidance reflects both of these changes. Where relevant, financial data for fiscal 2020 is recast for comparability. Please refer to our FY21 Financial Reporting Update on our IR website for additional information.\n\u2022 Net revenue is expected to be approximately $5.525 billion.\n\u2022 Change in deferred net revenue (online-enabled games) is expected to be approximately $25 million.\n\u2022 Net income is expected to be approximately $978 million.\n\u2022 Diluted earnings per share is expected to be approximately $3.35.\n\u2022 Operating cash flow is expected to be approximately $1.575 billion.\n\u2022 The Company estimates a share count of 292 million for purposes of calculating fiscal year 2021 diluted earnings per share.\n\u2022 Net bookings is expected to be approximately $5.550 billion. For comparison purposes, if fiscal 2020 were to be recast in the same way, we would have reported net bookings of $5.375 billion.\n\nIn addition, the following outlook for GAAP-based financial data and a long-term tax rate of 18% are used internally by EA to adjust our GAAP expectations to assess EA\u2019s operating results and plan for future periods:\n\u2022 Net revenue is expected to be approximately $1.220 billion.\n\u2022 Change in deferred net revenue (online-enabled games) is expected to be approximately $(220) million.\n\u2022 Net income is expected to be approximately $270 million.\n\u2022 Diluted earnings per share is expected to be approximately $0.93.\n\u2022 The Company estimates a share count of 291 million for purposes of calculating first quarter fiscal year 2021 diluted earnings per share.\n\u2022 Net bookings is expected to be approximately $1.000 billion. For comparison purposes, if the first fiscal quarter of 2020 were to be recast in the same way, we would have reported net bookings of $782 million.\n\nIn addition, the following outlook for GAAP-based financial data and a long-term tax rate of 18% are used internally by EA to adjust our GAAP expectations to assess EA\u2019s operating results and plan for future periods:\n\nFor more information about the nature of the GAAP-based financial data, please refer to EA\u2019s Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2019.\n\nElectronic Arts will host a conference call on Tuesday, May 5, 2020 at 2:00 pm PT (5:00 pm ET) to review its results for the fiscal fourth quarter and year ended March 31, 2020 and its outlook for the future.
