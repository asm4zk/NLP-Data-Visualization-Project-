   "content": "Drawing back the curtain on the R&D process\n\n\u2014 Why did Sony start up Future Lab Program\u2014and how did design get involved in the launch?\n\nOkamoto: People tend to see research and development as a kind of top-secret, off-limits area, but things are starting to change: in an effort to incorporate as much user feedback as possible, some companies are sharing their technologies fairly early on in the development process. We at Sony wanted to hear what users had to say about the value of the products we\u2019re developing as we work to create new lifestyles for the future\u2014and that motivation led us to launch Future Lab Program, an initiative that directs the focus toward joining forces with users in designing the future we\u2019re about to step into.\n\nWhat we had to figure out was how we could get the ideas we were hatching\u2014concepts that were still in development\u2014across to users. When you get into releasing concepts that are still in development, the key isn\u2019t the actual prototype itself. You need to concentrate on conveying the concept, making sure that the target audience understands exactly what you\u2019re going for; otherwise, you won\u2019t get the kind of feedback you really need. It all comes down to communication, really. That\u2019s why we decided to bring a design team on board and get help finding the best possible way to communicate with users.\n\nKanada: Building a new communication framework on an R&D foundation meant that we had to go right to the source: the research and development that have always been so crucial to our identity, giving us unique resources to blaze exciting paths and reflecting what the company does. We knew that we had to start by connecting with users up-front on a no-frills, essential wavelength\u2014instead of embellishing our R&D story and making it seem like something it\u2019s not, the key was to come out with an open approach that\u2019d welcome users directly into real-life research and development.\n\nIkeda: We wanted the design team to be active at a deeper level, too, not just on the visual side of things. We were always discussing things with designers as the program moved along.\n\nKanada: \u201cLab\u201d (Laboratory) is one of those words that have such a broad range of uses. The connotation we were going for was a professional, corporate R&D setting. We wanted to distill the whole essence of that authentic R&D experience\u2014tossing ideas back and forth, tweaking things through trial and error, and always seeking out new angles on concepts\u2014into our communication design."
