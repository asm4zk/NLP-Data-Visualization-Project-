   "content": "We began Lifelog app development by imagining how to illustrate a day in your life. Clearly, graphing how many steps you took or calories you burned is not very new or exciting. Why not make records of your day\u2019s events more entertaining? Surely we could add a touch of entertainment by presenting a visually rich experience of how and where you spent your time. To excite people with a fresh user experience, we explored the possibilities in lifelogging.\n\nAs we looked into all kinds of ideas and sketches, we realized that life can be seen as an adventure. This realization inspired Journey view, a mode where you scroll horizontally through the day\u2019s events. Look back over how you spent the day by scrolling through an animated timeline. It\u2019s entertaining, like a game. You\u2019re the main character, and your journey collects all of your everyday encounters and experiences. In this way, Lifelog app presents every day as another adventure."
