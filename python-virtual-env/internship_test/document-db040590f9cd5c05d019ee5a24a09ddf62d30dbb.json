   "content": "The Asama International Photo Festival 2019 PHOTO MIYOTA, a 56-day event that featured 728 works by photographers from around the world, included featured a unique collaboration between the Sony Creative Center and photographer Mr. Takashi Suzuki: an interactive exhibit titled \"YOU and BAU.\" What gave the exhibit experience its identity? It was a fusion of Sony's design capabilities and unique technologies that \"immersed\" viewers in Mr. Suzuki's work, giving life to a new mode of experiencing photography. Below, project members offer a behind-the-scenes look at the effort.\n\nThe Sony Creative Center jumped at the chance to be a part of the PHOTO MIYOTA exhibit, a program that \"attempts new possibilities for photography.\" What went into the concept behind the project?\n\nIkedaApproaching the project, we wanted to leverage Sony designs and Sony technologies to bring new experience value into art photography. As soon as we got word that we'd be exhibiting at PHOTO MIYOTA, we started talking about taking the company's unique technology for detecting moving objects and applying it to photos. It's a technology that can automatically detect a person in a given image, \"extract\" the person out of the original, and then overlay the person onto a completely different image\u2014all in real time. Sony has already incorporated the technology into the REA-C1000 Edge Analytics Appliance. So we got to thinking about how that might translate into a new kind of experience. Eventually, we arrived at a prototype idea: putting people into photography works, which we thought could be interesting. The PHOTO MIYOTA organizers thought so, too\u2014they saw the same potential we did, and they said they wanted us to put it in the showcase. That's how the project got going.\n\nLearn more about the REA-C1000 Edge Analytics Appliance here >\n\nWe didn't want to stop at just putting people into photos, though. We wanted to make the whole experience something new, something eye-opening, something memorable. Right from the start, we committed ourselves to three policies. First, we wanted to make sure that putting visitors into the photos would create a brand-new piece of art, not just a composite image. Second, the exhibit had to accentuate the aesthetic appeal of each photo by highlighting the contrast between the original work and the new version\u2014the person-in-photo version\u2014that the technology would create. Finally, the whole package had to be entertaining. What good is an interactive exhibit if you can't enjoy the experience, right? With our design goals in place, we started looking for an artist we could collaborate with.\n\nOguraAs we sought out photos that would be a good fit for our concept, we looked at works by a lot of different artists. One that really grabbed us was a photo series called \"BAU\" by Mr. Takashi Suzuki. The core theme informing the works is the idea of the \"recognition gap\" that forms when people view an image, a phenomenon that Mr. Suzuki highlighted through combinations of colorful sponges in different forms. Depending on the viewer's perspective, a sponge creation might look like a building; it might look like a person's face; it might look like something else altogether. The subjects of the photos have a cool aesthetic identity, and the conceptual payoff is just as compelling. For us, it was the perfect canvas for the immersion concept\u2014being in the photos would be like literally stepping into the recognition gap. We also knew it'd create a new work of art, given how the visitor in the photo could add to the look. When we approached Mr. Suzuki about using \"BAU,\" he got on board right away. He liked how it was a brand-new take on art, something that'd go beyond the conventional boundaries of art photography. With that, we got to work on crafting the actual experience."
