   "content": "The Frame Awards is the first and only global interior-design awards with a truly holistic approach. The Awards identify and honour the world\u2019s best interior projects, but also the people behind them. The work is judged by all industry stakeholders: interior designers, architects, retail brands, hospitality providers, cultural institutions, and educators. In total 36 awards are divided under Spatial, Executional, and Societal Awards covering the entire spectrum of interiors, while the Honorary Awards celebrate the people behind them. This time, there were over 1,076 submissions from countries all over the world, and from those submissions, five finalists for each award were nominated. The final judging will be held in Amsterdam, the Netherlands in February 2020, and representatives for each nominee will give presentations in front of the judges. The award winners will be honored at a grand ceremony where designers from all over the world will be gathered, and also be introduced in Frame's magazine and on its website."
