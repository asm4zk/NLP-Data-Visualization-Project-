   "content": "Flow cytometry systems are specialized equipment used in cell analysis and research. For Sony, entering into the their development and design was truly exploring new territory. Gaining insight for design all began with on-site observation and interviews, so that design would stem from in-depth observation of the functionality researchers need.\n\nWe observed some issues with current systems, which were large enough to dominate labs and complex enough (structurally and operationally) to inconvenience researchers. Researchers often had to rely on dedicated operators to obtain data, and this hampered research in various ways. We hoped that by applying Sony technology and expertise, we could resolve these issues and make the systems more accessible to researchers themselves. Ultimately, we knew that this would support future progress in medicine."
