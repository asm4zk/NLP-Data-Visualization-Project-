   "content": "IriyaWhen I took photos with film for this activity, I gained new respect for how Ishida always takes her photos this way, and I felt it is not something I could ever imitate. I mean, I think that in these times when everything is digital, it has to be nearly impossible to imitate a young person who can actually put photo collections and advertising works out there using film. I set out to take photos for one day, but several times during that day I would get anxious, thinking that the photo function might not be working, or that the photos would not develop correctly. If I were only doing it as a hobby, I would just get disappointed and quit, but work makes it a different story. I have actually had several misadventures with film cameras in the past.\n\nIriyaNormally in design, once brochures and printed materials come out there\u2019s no going back, but when it\u2019s digital you can make as many corrections as you want. Redo it once, redo it again, keep improving it and get as close to perfect as possible. That\u2019s another advantage you have with digital. However, this experience made me realize that a different type of world also exists. That\u2019s been my big takeaway from this. If I think I can fix it later, I tend to depend on that, kind of like an escape route. If I work on design with the sense of pressure that I only have one chance, like I\u2019m back in the analog days, I think it can help me create that particular value now more than ever. The way things were in the analog days, nothing was as easy to make as it is now. There were so many things you couldn\u2019t make even if you wanted to. Design really is something that brings about actual form, an entity, no matter what it is you try to express. Nowadays digital is the norm, and that\u2019s especially why this was such a great opportunity to rethink things."
