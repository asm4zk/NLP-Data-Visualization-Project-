   "content": "Making new value a part of everyday life\n\nThe Perspectives series follows Sony designers into a wide range of fields, where they glean new insights \n\nfrom experts and experienced veterans with diverse ways of thinking.\n\nFor this edition, designer Katsuji Miyazawa headed off to ACROS Fukuoka, a complex that opened in 1995. \n\nThe building's sloping side features a \"Step Garden\" that creates a forest-esque landscape against an urban backdrop.\n\nBehind the creation of that new, man-made ecosystem was landscape designer Michio Tase, \n\nwho has kept the garden thriving for more than 25 years. \n\nMiyazawa got a chance to talk with Tase about creating the landscapes of \n\nthe future\u2014and the conversation opened up a fertile dialogue of discovery."
