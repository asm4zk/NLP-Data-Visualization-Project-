Please note that certain information may have changed since the date of release.\n\nTokyo, Japan - Sony Corporation today announced its participation in \"500 ARTISTS WANTED,\" an artist support program sponsored by Music.com and operated by Inspiration is Everything, Inc. The program helps U.S. artists, creators and musicians impacted by COVID-19 continue engaging in creative and performance activities.\n\nThe global outbreak of COVID-19 has caused significant restrictions on music activities, including live concerts cancellations and music production studio closures. Sony will participate in and fund \"500 ARTIST WANTED,\" a program that supports amateur and professional artists' creation of \"360 Reality Audio\" music, an immersive audio experience utilizing object-based spatial audio technology.\n\nThere are two specific initiatives:\n\u2022 The songs and their unique stories will be solicited on Music.com, and 500 artists will receive $250 as a reward.\n\u2022 25 tracks will be selected by Music.com and Sony and will be remixed by professional sound engineers into 360 Reality Audio compatible tracks. The songs will then be featured on Music.com.\n\nFunding for this program will be provided by the \"Sony Global Relief Fund for COVID-19,\" which was established by Sony to help medical professionals at the forefront of the COVID-19 crisis, as well as children and creative communities affected by COVID-19.\n\n\"As a company closely connected to creators and the music industry, we aim to provide opportunities for artists and creators to share their music in this limiting environment by using immersive \"360 Reality Audio,\" said Hiroshi Nakamura, Senior General Manager of Mobile Product Business Division of Sony Home Entertainment & Sound Products, Inc.\n\n\"Music.com has been exploring ways to support the independent artist community in cooperation with Sony. This is our approach to helping. It's what we can do now,\" said Robby Wells of Music.com. \"There is something meaningful about working, so if we can hire artists to tell their stories to promote their song, we're happy to be in a position to do so.\"\n\nSony will continue to reinforce artist communities during this difficult time by lending its creative assets, technologies and financial support to aid their creative efforts.\n\n\n\nFor additional details, visit the following website"
