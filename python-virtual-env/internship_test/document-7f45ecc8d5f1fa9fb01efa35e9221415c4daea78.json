   "content": "Yamazaki: This project brought together people with wide-ranging backgrounds and expertise. I majored in chemistry at university and had never studied semiconductors. Moreover, I was assigned to semiconductor marketing when I joined the company. Today, I am in charge of deciding on the sort of specifications and promotions we should propose to customers. This means the experience and the ability to constantly take the customers' viewpoint that I acquired during my marketing days are still useful.\n\nBaba: My major at university was also totally unrelated to semiconductors as I was involved in research into robotics. I'm currently engaged in creating evaluation boards for ToF sensors. These evaluate the total system as modules that include lasers and lenses, not just the sensor as a single unit. The module is like a small robot because it incorporates both mechanical and electrical parts into a single unit. My current work suits my character well because it enables me to evaluate entire systems using the electrical and mechanical knowledge I gained from robotics.\n\nOhashi: I am currently in charge of fine-tuning ToF sensors installed in mobile devices for various applications, and provide the signal processing development team or the systems development team with feedback on any issues that may arise. As I researched signal processing at university and was put in charge of semiconductor systems after I joined the company, I do my best to provide appropriate feedback based on the knowledge I gained in both areas.\n\nMoriyama: I have been doing research on semiconductors since my university days, but was assigned to developing image sensors for SLR and other interchangeable lens cameras after I joined the company. For a time after I first joined my current department, I was troubled by the fact that my approach to developing image sensors that could check the performance ToF sensors for face recognition was not satisfactory. I was helped at the time by advice from someone who had experience in developing face recognition technology at another company. I was also greatly helped by the perspectives and knowledge of experts in spatial perception and mathematics. I really felt that at Sony, sensor development is underpinned by people from various backgrounds."
