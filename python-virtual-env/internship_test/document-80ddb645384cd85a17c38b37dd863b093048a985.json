   "content": "LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Coldwood and Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ: EA), today announced a partnership on the development of a new puzzle platformer game titled, Unravel\u2122. Unravel introduces Yarny, a tiny, new character made from a single thread of yarn, who embarks on a seemingly larger than life journey through the breath-taking, lush environments of Northern Scandinavia. Using Yarny\u2019s small thread and big heart, players will traverse nature\u2019s obstacles in this unique physics-based puzzle platformer. To watch the first gameplay trailer and learn more about the game, please visit www.unravelgame.com.\n\n\u201cThe idea of Unravel was created from a very personal place. We didn\u2019t start out by saying we\u2019re going to make a puzzle platforming game. We started by thinking more about our lives, and the things we hold meaningful. We wanted the game to have a heart and the gameplay could always be designed to represent that,\u201d says Martin Sahlin, Creative Director at Coldwood. \u201cThe tale of Unravel is about love, and the bonds between people. And the yarn is a representation of that. Yarny\u2019s red thread is the tie that connects everything in the game, from the gameplay mechanics to the story, and the people in it.\u201d\n\nUnravel is a game all about overcoming obstacles, both big and small. Some challenges are simple, like using Yarny\u2019s thread to swing across a gap, or rappel down a tree. Sometimes things get more complex, and players will need to use Yarny\u2019s thread in clever and creative ways to find the path forward. Whatever the case, no feat is too big for Yarny. Along the way, witness him unlock a heartfelt story about love and longing, and the ties that bind. The tale is told completely without words and Yarny is the red thread that runs through it all.\n\nUnravel will be available for digital download on Origin\u2122 for PC, the PlayStation\u00ae4 computer entertainment system, and Xbox One, the all-in-one games and entertainment system from Microsoft.\n\nTo join the conversation on Unravel, please follow us on Twitter\u00ae at www.twitter.com/unravel_game.
