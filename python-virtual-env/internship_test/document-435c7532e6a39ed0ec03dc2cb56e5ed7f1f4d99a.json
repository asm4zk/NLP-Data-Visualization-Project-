   "content": "An amazing BRAVIA viewing experience\u2014this goal originally inspired Monolithic Design in 2010, when the sets began to resemble an extremely simple slate. Sense of Quartz in 2013 inspired us to dig deeper and expose the natural beauty in what TVs are made of, through chiseled, crystalline surfaces.\n\n \n\n This year, owning a BRAVIA is more satisfying than ever. The line now combines and builds on these design themes to present materials, functions, and meaningful elements with even greater impact, through the most minimal forms imaginable. There\u2019s a kind of purity in their geometric shapes\u2014rectangles, circles, and triangles. Rectangles call to mind screens with impressive picture quality. Circles symbolize sound emerging from the round speakers. And triangles form a minimal yet stable-looking support for the large screens. Here, we had arrived at our new design theme: Pure Geometry."
