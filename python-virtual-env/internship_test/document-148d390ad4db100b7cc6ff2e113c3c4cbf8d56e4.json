   "content": "In BRAVIA\u00ae TVs, our quest for design that brings amazing viewing experiences into crystal-clear focus began in 2010 with Monolithic Design and continued in 2013 with Sense of Quartz. The next phase in 2014 was Pure Geometry. Essential qualities of TVs took the form of pure, minimalist geometric shapes. Design inspired by this thinking has taken the viewing experience to new heights while ensuring that sets complement furniture and the other, mainly geometric shapes in rooms well. \n\n\n\nSony home entertainment is becoming even more compelling in 2015, as this aesthetic carries over from TVs into sound bars, Blu-ray Disc\u2122 players and other products which together make up the \"composition\" of a room. There\u2019s a new level of harmony, and coordinated equipment is only the start. These systems also go well with furniture and lend coherence to the room as a whole. The inherent qualities of each polished device are clear, and their roles or functions are represented by pure geometric shapes. Beyond any individual product category, there\u2019s a compelling interplay among the shapes. The devices look natural together, no matter how or where they\u2019re arranged, and they tie a room together well."
