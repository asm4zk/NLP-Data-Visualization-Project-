   "content": "REDWOOD CITY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--During a panel today at Star Wars\u2122 Celebration in Chicago, Respawn Entertainment, a studio of Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA), announced that Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order \u2122, a new third-person action adventure game, will launch on November 15, 2019 on Xbox One, PlayStation\u00ae4 and PC via Origin\u2122. The game will feature an authentic story set shortly after the events of Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith\u2122, when the Jedi have fallen. Fans will play as a young Padawan named Cal Kestis, brought to life by Cameron Monaghan (Shameless, Gotham), who has survived Order 66, the Emperor\u2019s secret decree to eliminate all Jedi. Players must pick up the pieces of Cal\u2019s shattered past to complete his training and master the art of the iconic lightsaber - all while staying one step ahead of the Empire and its deadly Inquisitors.\n\n\u201cMany Star Wars fans, ourselves included, are really interested in the dark times, so we wanted to explore that mysterious, dangerous period,\u201d said Stig Asmussen, Game Director, Respawn Entertainment. \u201cThe team at Lucasfilm have been amazing collaborators, helping us explore and further develop this part of the timeline where the Empire is at the height of its power and any remaining Jedi are in hiding. Within this narrative, we\u2019ve crafted a game with intense, yet thoughtful and fun melee combat using the lightsaber and Force powers, allowing anyone to fulfill their Jedi fantasy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen Respawn approached us with the idea for this game, we were immediately supportive. A single player, story-driven title in the Star Wars universe was exactly what we were looking for, and we know the fans have been eager for one, as well,\u201d said Steve Blank, Director, Franchise Content & Strategy, Lucasfilm Story Group. \u201cFocusing on Cal stepping back into the shoes of a Jedi post Order 66 opens up a lot of gameplay opportunities and rich story threads to develop for this new character and his backstory.\u201d\n\nPlayers will meet Cal on Bracca, a brand-new Star Wars planet and one of several new locations introduced in the game. Cal is hiding from the Empire in plain sight but is forced to go on the run when he exposes his Force powers. Along the way, Cal will make new friends, like his mysterious companion Cere, as well as run into some familiar faces, all while being accompanied by his faithful droid BD-1. Cal\u2019s flight from the Empire is made even more dangerous as he is being pursued by the Second Sister, one of the Empire\u2019s elite Inquisitors, who seeks to hunt Cal down and extinguish this surviving Jedi. Assisting the Second Sister are the terrifying Purge Troopers, special Imperial forces trained to seek out Jedi and aid the Inquisitors in their dastardly work.\n\nStar Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is designed with gameplay as a top priority in order to deliver the kind of intense Star Wars lightsaber battles that are seen in the films. Brought to life by Respawn, a studio known for high-quality games that are both visually beautiful and technically masterful, players will use their Jedi training to create different melee combinations with an innovative lightsaber combat system and Force abilities. Players will also use traversal and other platforming abilities to strategically overcome opponents and solve puzzles in their path across this galaxy-spanning adventure. Star Wars fans will recognize iconic locations, weapons, gear, and enemies, while also meeting a roster of fresh characters, locations, creatures, droids and adversaries new to Star Wars.\n\nStar Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is available now for pre-order, and will offer fans unique cosmetic content.
