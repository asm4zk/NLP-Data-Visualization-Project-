   "content": "In March 2017, Sony made its way to Austin, TX (USA), to exhibit The WOW Factory at the 2017 edition of SXSW (South by Southwest) \u2014the world's largest creative business festival. The Sony design team had a big hand in the effort, designing four next-generation experiences and producing the communication design for the new The WOW Factory concept as a whole.\n\nWhat really separates SXSW from other business festivals is its genre-bending fusion of entertainment\u2014music and film, especially\u2014and digital technology. Heading into that unique environment, Sony decided to showcase a selection of prototypes that would resonate with that crossover mentality and give people a peek at the company's challenge for the future. Why did Sony want to pull back the curtain and open up the pipeline for all to see? It's all part of the \u201cMethod of Designing Experience Values,\u201d the company's current approach to design.\n\n\u201cOpenness\u201d is the core concept at the heart of the method. By developing the \u201cfuture experiences\u201d so central to its everyday efforts in an open fashion and making the experiences accessible to far-reaching audiences in open environments, Sony can draw from a deep, rich reservoir of valuable feedback in designing tomorrow's experience values.\n\nWith virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR) quickly gaining traction as big potential business drivers, the need for new formats in the entertainment sector and professional spheres is obvious. Artificial intelligence (AI), agents, and robotics, meanwhile, are making their way into domestic life, just one of the myriad new environments where the technologies are finding applications. As the tides in the seas of business and technology continue to shift, Sony recognizes the changing nature of design: It doesn't only revolve around physical value anymore\u2014now, experience value is the defining element.\n\nWhen you work with a design methodology that puts the focus on \u201cexperience,\u201d you have to develop the necessary technology and the necessary design in a parallel fashion\u2014both components shape each other. By leveraging Sony's technological assets, reaping the benefits of open communities, and employing rapid prototyping techniques, designers breathe life into captivating experiences and craft the emotional values of enjoyment, happiness, and wonder.\n\nSony knows full well that design\u2014what design embodies, what designers do, and what areas designers inhabit \n\n \u2014needs to change. At SXSW 2017, Sony captured that forward-looking attitude in its \u201cfactory\u201d for creating the \u201cwonders of the future.\u201d"
