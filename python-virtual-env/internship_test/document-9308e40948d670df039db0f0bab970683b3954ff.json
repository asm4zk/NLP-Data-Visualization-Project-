   "content": "Trendsetting and exciting ideas come from a clear sense of what people value today, and broad research and interviews can be insightful. What we found was a basic human desire for health and fulfillment, despite busy schedules. But we saw that rapid technological changes also bring stress that goes unnoticed, which may weigh on people\u2019s minds. Shouldn\u2019t technology support us and make life a little better? It was time to take a fresh look at technology through the lens of design, to introduce healthier habits for a more satisfying life.\n\nAs our designers were considering this topic, an intriguing application of camera image sensor technology was announced internally by our engineers. Besides showing us the world around us, sensors can also give us a clearer view of ourselves \u2013 by looking into our skin. Once the engineers showed in vivid detail textures, pores, and coloration unseen by the naked eye, designers imagined the health and beauty potential of skincare advice and solutions based on this data. Soon, a project began that united the zeal of engineers developing this technology with the determination of designers hoping to improve lives with it \u2013 a project that would bring Sony into the beauty industry for the first time."
