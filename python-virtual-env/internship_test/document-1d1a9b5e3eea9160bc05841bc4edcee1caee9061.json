   "content": "Given all the shifts reshaping our social realities and day-to-day lifestyles, we\u2019ll soon be inhabiting a world where the IoT\u2014a networked web of smartphone-controlled electronics ranging from audio devices and projectors to lighting, door locks, and other home appliances\u2014will form our spheres of daily existence. Developments in artificial-intelligence (AI) technology, meanwhile, are quickly making devices more responsive and convenient than ever: Instead of relying on manual user input, devices are now able to perform a multitude of tasks automatically at the sound of a voice command.\n\n Most home electronics obviously need to be within a certain size range, have access to power, and accommodate the other demands of regular domestic use. What it comes down to, then, is how products can blend simplicity, communication, and user-friendliness. As those needs started to come into view, Sony knew that it had to push its UI to the next level.\n\n The goal was to create a UI that would let users focus exclusively on what they wanted to do and know without having to give any thought to the devices or apps they\u2019re using. The ideal UI would play a non-intrusive role, only showing up when there was a clear need; it would do its job and then get quickly out of the way. To develop an \u201cAny Surface\u201d UI language capable of rendering a viable interface out of whatever the user was looking at, we set four core goals.\n\u2022 Keep high visibility in environments covering various ranges of information\n\u2022 Make the UI scalable to IoT devices that operate under capacity and power-consumption restrictions\n\nThe process of translating that vision into an actual UI design was a complicated effort, though. We needed to make sure that the focus on simplicity didn\u2019t result in a cold, dull feel\u2014the quality of the interface depended on interactivity that would give the design a kind of warmth, nestling the interface into the user space as harmoniously as possible."
