   "content": "Interactive CUBE is an entertainment experience that invigorates the senses by incorporating images, sounds, lights, and vibrations into a giant cube. Two screens, one of which is transparent, are formed into the shape of a cube and images are projected onto them, making guests inside the cube feel as if the images were floating in midair. Visitors could enjoy a variety of interactive games, and through our collaboration with the creative agency SIX, they could experience a new form of DJing where the messages in music are rendered visually and the lyrics appear as the song is being played."
