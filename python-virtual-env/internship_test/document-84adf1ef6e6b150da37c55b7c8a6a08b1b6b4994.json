   "content": "In the EDM world, lighting is an essential part of the groove. To replicate the unmistakable buzz of the festival scene, we crafted the color scheme to reflect the soft-loud dynamics of the music. The tube-light illumination, which ranges between \u201ccold\u201d and \u201cwarm\u201d color phases for chromatic contrast, synchronizes with the beat to deliver a pulsating palette of light\u2014the perfect complement to the trademark highs and lows of the EDM genre.\n\nBuilding on our unique beat-detection technology, we also developed an algorithm capable of identifying musical changes by the measure\u2014and in real time. The result, an illumination scheme that adapts freely to the tone and flow of every song, accentuates the music with smart lighting capabilities. The unit emits white flashes on the beat, too, but not just in a straight, constant pattern: The pulses speed up and slow down depending on how the song develops, automatically recreating the dynamics of live stage lighting."
