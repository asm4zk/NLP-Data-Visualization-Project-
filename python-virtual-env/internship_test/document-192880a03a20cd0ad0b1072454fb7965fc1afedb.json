   "content": "Place it down on a table. Set it up on a stand. Throw video onto a wall. Project recipes onto a countertop. With the Portable Ultra Short Throw Projector, users can let their imaginations run wild\u2014the device pretty much goes wherever you want it to go and does whatever you want it to do. The product design had to reflect that sense of liberating versatility, too, so we went with the most versatile shape of all: a simple square. Not only does a basic cubic form with sleek, rounded corners let the projector find a discreet, natural home in any space, but it also steers clear of any quirks that might limit what users can do with the device. Looking to incorporate even more versatility, we also designed the projector so that users could project content on a wall, rotate the main unit to point at a table or the floor, and have the same content show up there. Those design elements are a big part of what makes the Portable Ultra Short Throw Projector the game-changing device it is\u2014and the revolutionary value it gives users.\n\nFor the body of the device, we focused on creating a user-friendly, space-compatible design. To make sure that the unit would be easy to pick up and carry around, we kept the device as thin as possible and used a leather texture to give users a better grip. The special clear coating on the product keeps the device free of dirt and grime, too. The warm, natural white colour of the body makes working the device into life spaces a cinch, while the full-mesh plate provides openings for sound, heat from the optical unit, and sensors\u2014but keeps all those different parts out of sight and out of mind."
