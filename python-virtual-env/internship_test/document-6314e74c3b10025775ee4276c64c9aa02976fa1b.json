   "content": "How did the Motion Sonic Project get to where it is today?\n\nSuzuki (designer) : It all started with an idea from Heesoon Kim, an engineer who came up with the notion of capturing wind noise with wrist-mounted microphones and putting some effects on top of the input to translate body movements into intuitive sound.\n\nTakuma (chief art director) : A group of young engineers got the project going with a lot of energy, working hard to create new experience value. When ideas started to emerge, I got Suzuki on board to help visualize the concepts. For a while, though, we had to take a step back and let the team figure out how to actually turn the ideas into a viable UX.\n\nSuzuki : Our goal was to convert body movements into sound. When we started working out possible approaches, there were almost too many options to choose from: In addition to microphones, we had to test bending sensors, pressure sensors, gyrosensors, and lots of other sensors. It took a while before we could start making out clear solutions\u2014after all, we needed to have actual dancers wear the prototypes to see how they'd function in practice.\n\nTakuma : Devices that make sound when you move your body aren't that uncommon, actually. We decided to change things up by going further than simply having a sensor trigger the output. Our idea was to bring in the element of wind noise and use that input, not just motion-sensor readings, to generate sound. When we got around to focusing on the wind component, the device concept started to materialize.\n\nFor the engineers, the biggest thing was to make sure that the system would turn great kinetics\u2014like the sharp, agile movements of professional dancers and athletes\u2014into great sounds. That gave the Motion Sonic Project a little bit of a different personality from what we normally do: While end user-friendliness normally gets top priority, we were after a higher sense of sophistication.\n\nSuzuki : We started out with a minimal setup, trying to see how we could capture wind noise from different directions with just one microphone, but we eventually realized that using multiple microphones would give us more accurate, nuanced input. After a battery of trial runs, we finally found the optimal microphone arrangement for obtaining the maximum amount of wind noise without affecting the user's performance."
