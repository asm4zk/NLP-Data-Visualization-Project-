Players who have previously purchased SimCity for PC, either as a physical or a digital copy will receive the Mac version as a free digital download on Origin* on June 11.\n\n\u201cSimCity is coming to Mac on June 11 and one purchase will give you both the Mac and PC versions.

Via Origin, SimCity is cross-platform compatible, so all players will be able to play together across the same servers. Players will be able to play both versions with the same Origin account, allowing them to seamlessly continue their cities, achievements and leaderboard progress across the PC and Mac.\n\nSimCity has been rated E10+ by the ESRB and is currently available for PC and will be available for Mac on June 11.
