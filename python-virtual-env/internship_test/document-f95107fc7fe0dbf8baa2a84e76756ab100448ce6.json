   "content": "Evolving into an enduring look\n\nWhen you\u2019ve got a camera with the power to deliver astounding image quality, you\u2019re bound to want to take advantage of all the fine-tuned framing possibilities at your fingertips. That need was the reason why we decided to equip the RX1R II, the follow-up to the RX1, with a built-in electronic viewfinder and work the new feature into a configuration that was already dense to begin with. The first prototypes were about 20% bigger than the RX1, which made it seem like it might be impossible to keep the new model from feeling bulkier than the original\u2014but we knew we had to take on the challenge. We went back to square one with the internal structure, moving the lens barrel closer to the centre to open up some space for the viewfinder. To make sure that the viewfinder would fit inside the camera, we also developed a new mechanism that allowed the viewfinder eyepiece to retract into the camera. With the viewfinder compatible with the compact dimensions of the body, we came through with a camera design that stayed true to the original model.\n\nThe RX1 had a meticulous dial layout, an arrangement that packed the dials in so tight that there was hardly any room for modifications. When the RX1R II concept came along and brought a built-in viewfinder into the mix, however, we naturally had to make adjustments\u2014but we also had to be careful not to make the changes too drastic. To make sure that we didn\u2019t interfere with the operability that users of the first model had grown familiar with, we could only make minuscule, micron-level tweaks to the layout. Another thing we had to adjust was the lens position, which has an impact on the overall impression of the camera. As we made countless modifications to the location of the Sony logo and the balance of the grip width, we eventually managed to recapture that refined \u201cphotography tool\u201d look. Behind all those details and minor modifications was the dogged determination of Sony engineers and designers, who knew that they had to deliver a camera that would only grow on users over time."
