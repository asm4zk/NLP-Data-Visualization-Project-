   "content": "REDWOOD CITY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Calling all pilots! Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ:EA), Motive Studios and Lucasfilm today announced Star Wars\u2122: Squadrons , an immersive, first-person space dogfighting experience set in the beloved Star Wars\u2122 galaxy. Star Wars: Squadrons will feature thrilling 5v5 multiplayer dogfights, monumental fleet battles, and an original story set during the final days of the Galactic Empire and the rise of the New Republic after the events of Star Wars: Return of the Jedi\u2122. The game will launch October 2, 2020 on PlayStation\u00ae4, Xbox\u00ae One, PC via Origin\u2122, Steam and the Epic Games Store, and will be playable via Virtual Reality (VR) on PlayStation\u00ae 4 and PC with cross-play support. Tune into EA Play Live on June 18 at 4:00pm PT for the gameplay reveal of Star Wars: Squadrons.\n\n\u201cWe created this game for every Star Wars fan who has ever dreamt about soaring across the galaxy in their favorite starfighter,\u201d said Ian Frazier, Creative Director, Motive Studios. \u201cThrough the collaboration of the teams at Motive and Lucasfilm, we\u2019ve been able to create a high-fidelity starfighter experience with an authentic storyline that invites Star Wars fans to explore never-before-seen corners of the galaxy in their own ship. We\u2019re excited to show all this in action this week at EA Play Live.\u201d\n\nIn Star Wars: Squadrons, players will enlist as starfighter pilots, stepping into the cockpits of iconic starfighters from both the New Republic and Imperial fleets. They\u2019ll plan skirmishes with their squadron in the briefing room before taking off for space battles across the galaxy. Players will engage in strategic 5v5 multiplayer space battles with the goal of demolishing the opposing flagship in Fleet Battles and will feel the rush of first-person multiplayer combat as they work with their squadron to defeat as many opponents as possible in Dogfights. Pilots will triumph as a team, adjusting the composition of their squadrons to suit their playstyles as they progress, crushing their opponents and completing objectives across known and never-before-seen locations, including the gas giant of Yavin Prime and the shattered moon of Galitan.\n\nStar Wars: Squadrons will offer rich cosmetic and gameplay customization options with rewards and bonuses that are earned solely through gameplay. As players move up the ranks, they\u2019ll earn components such as weapons, hulls, engines and shields to customize the performance of their starfighters; and gain cosmetic items to customize their cockpit, ship exteriors, and appearance of their pilot. In addition, players will be able to squad up with their friends and play against others, regardless of platform, as cross-play will be supported on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PC, and VR.\n\nStar Wars: Squadrons will also feature a single-player story that brings to life events following the Battle of Endor when the Rebel Alliance has successfully destroyed the Death Star II. Through the story, players will learn what it means to be a pilot as they battle from the alternating perspectives of two customizable pilots, one serving in the New Republic\u2019s heroic Vanguard Squadron, while the other fights for the Galactic Empire\u2019s fearsome Titan Squadron. The authentic story features a diverse cast of original characters, as well as some cameos from familiar faces in the Star Wars galaxy.\n\nStar Wars: Squadrons is available now for pre-order* and lands on retail and digital storefronts on October 2 for $39.99.
