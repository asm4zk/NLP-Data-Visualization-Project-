   "content": "The seeds of the Interactive CUBE project first took root when ISETAN The Japan Store Kuala Lumpur, which opened in 2016, asked Sony to handle its spatial design. In the client's eyes, the target result was a Sony-esque design that would create indelible experiences for every visitor. Working to distill that vision into more practical terms, the design team decided to pair Sony's short throw projection capabilities with transparent screens to cast layers of video in a three-dimensional box\u2014and, on top of that, have the display metamorphose in response to people's movements. It all centered on the idea of a responsive, dialogic space; CUBE was born. When the installation went into operation, the concept proved itself a success. Scores of visitors, whether they actually stepped into the cube or just watched from a distance, marveled at experiences that they had never encountered before.\n\nA subsequent event in Beijing was the setting for the CUBE's second incarnation, an improvement over the first version. To enhance overall platform versatility, the design team ran a battery of simulations on different projection angles and other factors to arrive at a simpler structure. Next came the third-generation Interactive CUBE, which Sony chose to exhibit at SXSW\u2014the world's foremost business festival\u2014for a showcase of compelling experiential value at a high-exposure gathering. To maximize the impact of the technology at SXSW 2018, designers switched the projection surface from glass to film for easier operability and collaborated with outside creators in pushing the entertainment factor in new, exciting directions."
