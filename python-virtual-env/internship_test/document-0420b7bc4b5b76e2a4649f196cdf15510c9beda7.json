(NASDAQ: EA), Respawn Entertainment and Lucasfilm released the highly anticipated story-driven action adventure game, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order\u2122. Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order follows Cal Kestis, played by Cameron Monaghan (Gotham, Shameless), on an incredible journey packed with memorable companions, nefarious villains, diverse planets, thrilling lightsaber combat, impressive Force abilities and cinematic moments, all within the much beloved Star Wars\u2122 galaxy.\n\nStar Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is now available worldwide on Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and PC via Origin and Steam. Also, as announced earlier, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is now available on the Epic Games Store, expanding the number of options that players have to jump into this new Star Wars adventure.\n\n\u201cWorking on Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order has been a dream come true for me and many people on the team,\u201d said Stig Asmussen, Game Director at Respawn Entertainment. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t be more excited to get the game into the hands of fans worldwide so they can live out the ultimate fantasy of becoming a Jedi. We created a new team that\u2019s made up of action adventure veterans to create this experience and we\u2019ve worked hand-in-hand with Lucasfilm throughout development to create a highly authentic story, cast of characters, and unique gameplay experience that will live on as part of the Star Wars galaxy.\u201d\n\nIn Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, players take on the role of Cal Kestis, a former Padawan hiding in plain sight after the Jedi were all but wiped out after Order 66 was executed by The Emperor. When he\u2019s forced on the run, Cal is quickly met by his companions Cere Junda, a former Jedi Knight played by Debra Wilson and Greez, the larger-than-life Latero pilot voiced by Daniel Roebuck, who flies the crew\u2019s ship known as the Stinger Mantis. BD-1, Cal\u2019s faithful droid that\u2019s as charming as he is useful, will help players navigate and explore diverse planets including the Wookiee homeworld, Kashyyyk, and the never-before-seen planet Zeffo. Cal and his companions are trying to stay one step ahead of the Empire and his new enemy, the Inquisition\u2019s Second Sister, while they unravel a mystery tied to an ancient alien civilization that could help rebuild the Jedi Order.\n\nIn a time where it\u2019s increasingly dangerous for Jedi, players will experience Cal\u2019s journey from a young Padawan to a Jedi Knight. Cal\u2019s lightsaber and Force abilities take center stage in Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order\u2019s dynamic combat. Every battle is unique as players engage an array of enemies, from creatures and droids to stormtroopers and elite Purge Troopers to showdowns with AT-STs and powerful bosses. Throughout his quest, Cal will strengthen his connection with the Force, learning powerful new skills which will be crucial in combat as well as for traversing and opening up new paths across these beautiful yet dangerous locales.\n\nStar Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is now available both digitally and in stores on Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and PC via Origin, Steam and the Epic Games Store. Origin Access Premier subscribers will get full access to Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order Deluxe Edition on PC for as long as they are subscribed.
