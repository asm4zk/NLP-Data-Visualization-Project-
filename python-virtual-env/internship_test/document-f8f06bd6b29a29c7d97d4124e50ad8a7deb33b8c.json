   "content": "On January 6 at CES 2020 in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA, Sony announced its new pursuit of safety, enjoyment, and entertainment in mobility with the VISION-S. The Sony booth at the event also showcased a VISION-S Prototype model.\n\nSony's Creative Center design team designed this prototype with an oval-shaped concept to symbolize the experience of full 360-dregree immersion in sensing technologies and entertainment. Advancements in sensing technology have changed the value of mobility, enabling even greater levels of safety and entertainment. Based on this new value and the ongoing evolution that next-generation connectivity creates, the team then came up with a platform for a four-passenger EV including original designs for the exterior, interior, UX/UI, and even communication design. The end result expresses both Sony-style simplicity and the cutting-edge feel of an EV."
