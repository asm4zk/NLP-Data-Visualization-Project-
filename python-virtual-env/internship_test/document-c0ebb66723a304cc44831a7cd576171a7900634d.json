   "content": "Seeking a fresh aesthetic for home theater products that would complement furniture and living rooms \u2013 not to mention BRAVIA\u00ae TVs \u2013 inevitably led to Pure Geometry for sound bars and Blu-ray Disc players. Core qualities were narrowed down, and functions were framed in minimalist, geometric shapes. The resulting products look unified and fit rooms well, despite combining different product categories.\n\nEach essential role \u2013 playing audio with presence or displaying images with impact, for example \u2013 is matched with the perfect geometric shape and a distinctive finish. In sound bars, these simple geometric forms represent elements that produce superb sound, such as the speakers and amps. In Blu-ray Disc players, they represent elements linked to reading and controlling discs, such as the disc tray and controls. These key features are further set apart by finishes that are matte, glossy, or otherwise distinctive. Consistent details across product categories \u2013 such as specific edge curvature for better sound, or a leather-grain finish on certain surfaces \u2013 enhances the coherence of systems as a whole."
