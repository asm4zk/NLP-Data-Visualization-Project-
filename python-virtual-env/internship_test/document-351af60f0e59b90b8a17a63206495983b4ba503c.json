   "content": "To say the format would be innovative was an understatement. This product had never existed before. How would this kind of smartphone companion be used? We had to imagine everyday scenes. Designers participated from the planning stage by turning our thoughts about the user experience into concrete images. Soon, we were considering scenes with people shooting on trips, at caf\u00e9s, and at parties, as we 3D-printed mock-ups and discussed what format would suit these real-world situations. Ultimately, the most compelling form for the camera resembled a kind of interchangeable lens for smartphones. People would intuitively want to attach a lens-shaped camera to their phone, and immediately knowing how to use this new product was important to us."
