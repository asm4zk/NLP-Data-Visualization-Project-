The effort to redefine the Sony Mobile vision started with a proposal from a designer.\n\nMaesakaI took the role of directing key visuals, promotional videos, and communication design for the Xperia\u2122 smartphone brand. One of the challenges we'd been facing was uneven communication planning\u2014it's hard to get consistency when you've got lots of different project members and different subcontractors in the mix. We came up with some proposals to help smooth everything out and keep the Xperia brand consistent, but it was challenging to get employees on the same page globally. With commoditization transforming the smartphone landscape, meanwhile,there were worries that we weren't creating products with Sony's unique identity.\n\nAs we started thinking about how to turn the tides, we eventually came around to the corporate vision: if we could redefine the core philosophy for the whole company, we figured, the company might be able to regroup and start moving in the right direction. It wasn't like there was no corporate vision, of course, but what the company did have was pretty abstract, which didn't seem to be getting through to employees. We decided to approach President Kishida, who'd just taken the helm. We told him that redefining the corporate vision to unite the employees in a clearer, more concrete mindset would give the company a better chance of winning in the smartphone market, and we asked him if we could set up some brainstorming workshops to get the ball rolling.\n\nKishidaMaesaka's proposal was a wakeup call. I could tell that he wanted to overhaul the whole Xperia brand, and I knew that was exactly what we needed. I'd actually been part of the team that set up Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications, which later grew into Sony Mobile, so taking over at Sony Mobile felt a lot like coming home to me. When I took a good look at the company, the first thing I noticed was that the stiff competition in the smartphone market hadn\u2019t sapped anyone's drive\u2014every employee was just as passionate as ever about making great devices. I could tell that Sony Mobile had almost everything you could ask for, from technological prowess and sales expertise to top-notch marketing capabilities. What it didn't have, though, was a vision that brought all those elements together. If we had a stronger identity, we could really tap into all that amazing potential. That\u2019s why we had to push Maesaka\u2019s proposal forward\u2014with market dynamics and social changes always in flux, we needed something that'd keep the whole company locked in to a consistent, coherent track.\n\nThings moved quickly from there. At a general meeting of all Sony Mobile employees, I announced that we'd be redefining the corporate vision and unveiling the new statement at the MWC19 Barcelona, the world\u2019s largest international exhibition for the mobile industry. I asked the design team to spearhead the project to formulate the new vision, and they agreed to lead the way."
