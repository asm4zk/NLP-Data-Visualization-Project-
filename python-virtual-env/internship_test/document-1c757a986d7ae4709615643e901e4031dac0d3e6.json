   "content": "The Perspectives series follows Sony designers into a wide range of fields, where they glean new insights \n\n from experts and experienced veterans with diverse ways of thinking. This edition shines a spotlight on Takayuki Kitahara, a communication designer with a focus on product communication and corporate branding, who paid a visit to the ISSEY MIYAKE headquarters in Tomigaya, Tokyo. There, Kitahara met with Yoshiyuki Miyamae\u2014a leading member of the ISSEY MIYAKE design team since 2011\u2014to get a \n\nunique perspective on exciting innovations in the manufacturing world, born of a union between design and technology.\n\n That initial encounter sparked an ongoing dialogue, \n\none that has helped Kitahara develop new knowledge and valuable insight.\n\nCollaborating for a new value Mr. Miyamae said something that really grabbed me. \"I don't do any sketches myself,\" he said. \"Expressing my ideas too much will end up in limiting the team's collective creativity.\" When directing a designing team, Mr. Miyamae wants his team to design things that go beyond his imagination\u2014and that focus on liberating creativity, I think, is what lets him get the most out of the team. Creating a piece of clothing is a multi-step process. You start out with raw materials, which you then turn into thread. From there, you have to decide how to weave or knit the thread together. That sets you up for the last stage, turning the fabric into a piece of clothing. If any one component of that process strays out of alignment, you can\u2019t get the final product you\u2019re aiming for. It mirrors the weaving process; every element is its own strand, and the final product is the composite of every thread. The people on Mr. Miyamae's team take ownership of their respective tasks, investing themselves in ensuring that their strands fall in line with the bigger vision. In today's world, there's no such thing as manufacturing without collaboration. That was a big takeaway from my conversations with Mr. Miyamae: appreciation of the importance to bring personnel together within the company, outside the company, and across different sectors\u2014engineering, planning, sales, and more\u2014for a shared goal.\n\nOne of my recent projects focuses on Sony's new material, \"Triporous\", which contains massive quantities of unique nanopores and micropores, which adsorbs odors and a variety of different substances. How can Sony spread those benefits to a broader audience? To reach out on a B-to-B level, and further to the general public, we had to do more than just lay out the technological features and scientific functions. No matter how powerful or groundbreaking a technology might be, to get people to understand how special the innovation is, you need to capture the key features and present them in a simple fashion.\n\nWe wanted the promotion of Triporous to resonate with the audience so they can understand and get interested in it. Therefore, we emphasized on phrases like \"An innovative Material for Purifying Water and Air\" and the raw material, rice husks, and designed our websites around these characteristics to tell the core characteristics which made this material unique. Sony has an array of other technologies in its repertoire. Through effective communication, I know that we can showcase the wide-ranging functionality and extraordinary promise of those innovations on a global stage\u2014and help turn them into powerful business drivers for users around the world.\n\nThe essence is always the same: \n\nMaking clothes that move people Some clothing manufacturers might have specific targets in mind when they tackle new lineups. Maybe they want to make clothes that fold up into nice, compact sizes to save space. Maybe they want to put the environment first and deliver a set of eco-friendly wear. For Mr. Miyamae, though, there's only one ideal worth thinking about: creating clothes with an emotional impact. Clothes that people can't wait to wear out on the town, clothes with looks that get people talking and spark communication\u2014what matters to Mr. Miyamae is how people feel about what they wear. With the user experience firmly at the foundation of Mr. Miyamae's approach, the designs take on features like travel convenience and environmental friendliness as extensions of that central perspective. We adopted that same kind of approach in designing the communication for Triporous. Sony products and services only become sources of value when people actually use them. Communication has to set its roots in the user perspective, always keeping real-life usage scenarios in mind. These days, it's a pretty rare occasion when something completely new emerges\u2014but that doesn't stop Mr. Miyamae from taking up the challenge. He doesn't just focus on creating things that are unique for their own sake, though; he's not after surface-level appeal. He cares about the sustainability of manufacturing, engages with the technologies, rolls the process all the way back to material development, and seeks out novel fundamental concepts to create what today's world needs. Hearing him talk about how he embraces all the tasks at hand, I found myself identifying with that commitment to creativity on a deep, powerful level."
