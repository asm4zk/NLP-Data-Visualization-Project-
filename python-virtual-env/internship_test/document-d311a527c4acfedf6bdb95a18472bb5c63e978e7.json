   "content": "The idea for toio came from Sony engineers who wanted to give children something real to play with, not just another virtual diversion like a video game. As the product started to take shape, designers got on board and immediately set to reexamining the experience value at the heart of the system. Numerous meetings and discussions gradually gave the team a clearer idea of what we were after: an essential form of play that would bring children into a world of fun, inspiration, and growth through the creative process.\n\nWith that basic concept in place, the designers came up with an idea for a ring-shaped controller. The project team had been envisioning a conventional, handheld controller that would echo standard gaming interfaces. The toio designers' approach, however, not only marked a stark departure from the traditional approach but also embodied a unique design message\u2014focusing on both nurturing children's capacities for imaginative thinking and foregrounding the real-life, unimaginary play experience so vital to the toio concept."
