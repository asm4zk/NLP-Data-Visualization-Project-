   "content": "Cooking, arranging flowers, scribbling, talking\u2014creativity is everywhere in our daily lives. \n\n Take a second to look into our creativity, and enjoy being that creator.\n\n Someone told me that \"Walking on a predetermined path is boring,\" but is there really such a thing as a predetermined road?\n\n When we look at the world, we have no idea what to expect.\n\nNobody knows what lies in our future; the world changes every day.\n\nWhat does the future look like for the relationship between \"humans\" and \"technology?\" Technology has enriched our lives, but will there be a day when technology overtakes human beings?\n\n Rather than thinking about dominating or being dominated, I personally want to live in harmony with technology, and I believe we can do it.\n\n Look at \"water\" and \"oil.\" They don\u2019t mix at first, but after a while, they harmonize to create delicious salad dressing.\n\n I think creativity in all of us will be key to harmonizing humanity and technology to enrich our lives."
