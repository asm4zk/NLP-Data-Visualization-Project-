Things continue to evolve in Japan, too, with user experiences always taking new forms and technological advances in artificial intelligence driving development. \n\n We\u2019ve poured our energies into helping people get the most out of all the content out there on the Internet in a way that\u2019s right for them. One of the biggest content areas is news, a segment that people explore on a day-to-day basis and the focus of our latest project: News Suite.\n\nAkagawa: The question that we had to deal with was how people can use the Internet to get the kinds of information they like. For most people, it\u2019s really hard to zero in on exactly the content they want right out of the gate\u2014they tend to start by looking at a pretty wide range of stuff first, get a basic grasp of the available content, and then pinpoint the information they\u2019re interested in.\n\nThat\u2019s where the idea of the \u201cJ model\u201d comes from. We kind of visualized the whole process of finding target information as looking like a \u201cJ\u201d: you start at the top, swimming on the surface of the vast \u201cinformation ocean,\u201d and then plunge down into an area you\u2019re interested in. Once you\u2019ve made the dive into the deeper reaches, you find something that really catches your eye and veer toward that\u2014hence the curl at the bottom of the J.\n\nUeki: When it comes to information, most people have a hard time identifying their own likes and dislikes by name\u2014they need a base of general, wide-ranging information before they know where they want to go with it. That\u2019s one of the insights we got from our user interviews.\n\nAkagawa: Knowing how important it was to give users a smooth, direct route to locating the information they like and delving deeper into content, we decided to focus on the structure of the app first. We came up with as many patterns as we could and tested them on groups of users, who eventually said that the easiest setup was an interface with two tabs: \u201cNews\u201d and \u201cMy Feeds.\u201d"
