   "content": "Several years ago, when I was in charge of a product design, another designer from the team and I took two sketches, Idea A and Idea B, and set out into the streets. We compared the people coming and going with the sketches of a product geared towards those young users. We looked at one person, and then another, and wondered if they would use the product. We considered which of the products would fit the place we were at. When you\u2019re out in the market and you look at a sketch you made in the office, there are definitely times when you think that it doesn\u2019t really fit. About two years ago, I came up with such a wonderful design that I personally thought it should be stored at the MoMA. However, when I confidently told people I met in the street about the design, they didn\u2019t get it at all. I then discarded the entire design and started thinking about it again from scratch. I learned that even if you think a design is wonderful and worthy of a prize, it doesn\u2019t mean that people will want it. In the past, when I was talking with people from a Silicon Valley venture business, the phrase \u201cdesign verification\u201d came up, which means proving that your design works by finding out how third parties perceive it. I felt that Kawamura talking about how he \u201calways holds 200 review meetings in his head\u201d is close to this, with his anecdote that he verifies his work over and over in his mind until it gets released to the public. Kawamura reviewing things in his head is one method of design verification. Personally, I go out into the streets to check if my designs work."
