   "content": "Sony has enlivened routines and user experiences through many products over the years, but this time our approach builds on your living room itself. As we studied rooms of all kinds, it renewed our appreciation of how rooms set the scene for entertainment. Building on existing elements such as walls or tables seemed a promising way to reveal unseen potential in your own home. And as we sought to tap this potential, it inspired a new approach to the user experience \u2014 Life Space UX.\n\nWe began by considering the potential of living room walls. Wouldn\u2019t it be exciting to use walls as vast display surfaces? It would surely transform a room\u2019s ambience. Inspired, we looked into combining short-range projection with 4K imaging. Development of an 4K ultra short throw projector was soon underway."
