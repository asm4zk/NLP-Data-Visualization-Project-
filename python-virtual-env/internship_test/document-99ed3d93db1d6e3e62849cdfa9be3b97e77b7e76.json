   "content": "Fusing the technological magic \n\ninto new value\n\nSony was looking for a way to use its high-speed vision sensors, capable of tracking moving objects at 1,000 frames per second, to craft a brand-new, revolutionary user experience. That was the core vision behind the A(i)R Hockey project. What the showcase designers wanted to do, then, was not to explain how the technology works\u2014they wanted to create an entertainment experience that would let users play their way to an intuitive, visceral understanding of the innovation.\n\nThe process started out with a fundamental question: how could Sony deliver fun, exciting experiences that made the most of its high-speed sensing technologies? Brainstorming hundreds of ideas, from baseball and other ball sports to a host of other games across the spectrum, the team eventually came around to air hockey\u2014a game with both a universal appeal and an optimal format for showcasing the technology. With Sony's high-speed vision sensors tracking the virtual pucks zooming across the playing surface and the unique predictive algorithms enabling responsive trajectory mapping, the engineers knew that they could keep the projections of all the moving pieces in perfect sync. Sony's haptics technology, capable of applying tactile sensations to the interface, could imbue the virtual pucks with a realistic \"touch\" and take the AR experience to a whole new level. The technological components were all in place\u2014it was time for the team to make A(i)R Hockey a reality."
