   "content": "For the MDR-Z1R, we focused intently on the design of the housing to reproduce a sound space that is true to the original sound. The housing has a significant effect on sound quality and can create unwanted resonance or distort sound. We went back to the basics to design a housing that would reduce resonance as much as possible. It was the image of an inflated sail that gave us the clue we needed. We turned our attention to designing a housing that would, like cloth, naturally embrace the sound pressure generated by the diaphragm. This concept led us naturally to the flowing, organically curved design of the housing. The single-sheet gentle curve reduces as much vibration and eliminates as much resonance as possible.\n\nThe dual housing structure with a permeable acoustic resistor and wire mesh protector controls air flow through the housing to reproduce the full expanse of natural sound. This combination not only reproduces great sound, but also helps achieve the ambient silence that we were seeking."
