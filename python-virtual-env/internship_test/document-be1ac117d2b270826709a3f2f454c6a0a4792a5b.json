   "content": "Sony Design: MAKING MODERN \u2013The Challenge to Create an Archetype\u2013, an event to commemorate the publication of Sony Design: MAKING MODERN, \n\n took place from April 29 to June 14, 2015 at the Sony Building in Ginza, Tokyo. \n\n Around 30 products from the 70s to today were placed on display. Historic products such as the original WALKMAN\u00ae, \n\n which gave birth to today's \"listen on the go\" lifestyle,\u201d and the Profeel, which created a new concept in TVs, are nostalgic, yet fresh even today. \n\n PlayStation\u00ae and other more recent products were also put on display, \n\n giving insights into the evolution and maturation of Sony Design to many visitors from varied demographics during this 47-day event."
