   "content": "At SXSW 2017, Sony featured three programs for the Immersive Space Entertainment concept: 360 Movie, which gives users intuitive control over 360-degree video, Music Visualizer, which renders sound in a visual format, and Cyber Gym, which offers a new take on what entertainment can be. What were you aiming for with that content\u2014and how did people respond to the experiences?\n\nNashida : When we started developing the first one, 360 Movie, the initial idea was to have the system detect the orientation of the user's face and transform the visuals accordingly. That ended up being too sensitive, we found. Linking the visuals with chair movements, though, made for a much smoother experience and gave the experience a more natural, immersive quality. Without prototyping different ideas first, we wouldn't have been able to come up with that kind of \"sensory design.\" That's a big part of our development process. It's an offering that brings the awe-inspiring experience of enveloping, high-resolution immersion\u2014the IMAX theater approach\u2014into a small, intimate space. It really gave me a thrilling taste of what future media could be.\n\nMusic Visualizer, meanwhile, generates high-precision, real-time visualizations of audio input. It redefines the music experience, giving you a new, refreshing way of engaging with sound content. You don't just listen to music with your ears any more\u2014with Music Visualizer, you listen to it with your eyes.\n\nThe third package we showcased was Cyber Gym, an interactive space that integrates a stationary bike with moving visual projections on a dome-shaped screen. As the user rides the bike, the system tracks the user's leaning motion, pedaling speed, and other movements and then uses that input to modify the video surrounding the rider. The technology was the most popular part of our showcase\u2014some people said they couldn't wait to have their own Cyber Gym systems. The setup occupies quite a bit of space, so our first target segments will probably be gyms and other larger-scale facilities. Having seen Cyber Gym in action at SXSW, I think it would be cool to see the technology grow into a platform for entertainment-oriented exercise.\n\nImmersive Space Entertainment has the potential to be more than just a big-screen TV\u2014the products could revolutionize the concepts of space and time in virtual experience media, I think. To make that transformation as powerful and far-reaching as possible, we're going to focus on making the devices more compatible with home settings and giving users easier access to what the technology can do. We've still got a long way to go, though."
