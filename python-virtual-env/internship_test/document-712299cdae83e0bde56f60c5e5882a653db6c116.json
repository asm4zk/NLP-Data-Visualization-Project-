   "content": "After hearing about the idea, the Sony Pictures marketing team sent the Sony design team a list of feasible titles for a joint project. The designers then went through the options film by film, thinking about how each one might translate into an AR-geared experience. When the team got to Ghostbusters, they knew they had a winner. It was a popular movie with a clear, familiar worldview. It was a good fit for AR technologies. It helped that plenty of people on the team were huge Ghostbusters fans growing up, too. Once the choice was made, the work began. The translucent ghosts were relatively easy to render via AR technologies, so the team got to playing with the idea of enlisting participants as \"rookie Ghostbusters\" on a mission to locate and exterminate \"real ghosts\" in an outdoor setting. Straightforward, fun, and exciting-it checked three key boxes, so the team floated the concept of the experience to Sony Pictures executives and original Ghostbusters (1984) director Ivan Reitman. \"This is great!\" They said. \"Let's do it at our studio!\" With that, the project got the green light.\n\nThe origins of the GHOSTBUSTERS ROOKIE TRAINING initiative trace back to an AR glasses demo that was in development at the Sony R&D Center. Instead of just experimenting on a single technology with isolated development elements, the engineers behind the glasses wanted to create an integrated customer experience and get direct feedback from the gaming world, the entertainment industry, and regular users so that they could figure out what technologies they would need to apply AR in an entertainment mold and what challenges they would have to navigate through. Eventually, they came to the design team with an idea: what about using AR to transform real spaces into \"play spaces?\" What if we could create a new take on entertainment experiences? Hearing what the engineers had to say, the design team thought of the optimal route to take: a collaboration with Sony Pictures in Los Angeles, California.\n\nHave you ever wished you could throw on a Ghostbusters uniform and battle some ghosts yourself? Well, Sony created a program to grant that wish: \"GHOSTBUSTERS ROOKIE TRAINING,\" an interactive augmented-reality (AR) experience that lets players zap and trap ghosts just like in the movies. Through a collaborative arrangement with Sony Pictures Entertainment (\"Sony Pictures\"), the project took a demo of AR technologies and turned it into a fun-filled entertainment experience. The Sony designers and engineers behind the project worked to fuse Sony technologies and Sony content into a new world.\n\nThere were several main objectives of the GHOSTBUSTERS ROOKIE TRAINING. The overarching goal was to fuse the ordinary and the extraordinary into a brand-new entertainment experience. Naturally, the team also had to come up with the right technological means for making the experience a reality. The other core aim was a more conceptual one: immersing players in a distinctive cinematic ambience and getting them to take command of the experience like they were the stars of the whole show. To get the ball rolling, the developers focused on what would make extraordinary, out-of-this-world experiences feel real. It all started with that abstract idea, which the team prototyped into potentially feasible approaches. The process involved a lot more than just visual content. From the weighty, mechanical \"Ghost Traps\" and the tactile sensation of shooting laser beams at ghost targets to set pieces that would need to start moving out of the blue, the team started looking closely at times when everyday reality and movie-magic unreality would overlap. As they dug deeper, they got around to the idea of creating interactions between physical things-people and objects, for example-with virtual imagery, like setups where a virtual ghost would appear to move something physically occupying the space. They then went about weaving those eye-popping, catch-your-breath moments into the whole scenario of players walking around a city set in an actual studio environment in search of ghosts. For the team, it was all about making the encounters with the space's otherworldly inhabitants as realistic as possible-like everything was taking place in normal, everyday life.\n\nTo pull people into the Ghostbusters universe, the team used gaming elements that would enhance the experience's entertainment payoff. The key feature of AR is that it lets you see the real world along with virtual content, which is why the development team decided to make the experience a team effort. Each team had three members: one responsible for spotting ghosts, one in charge of placing the \"Ghost Trap\" for capturing the ghosts, and one tasked with getting the ghosts into the trap. They all had to communicate and work together, and AR let them do that: they always had a foundation in the physical surroundings and their teammates in real space. The developers also counted players' steps and tracked their speeds during the design phase, using their findings to time and stage the ghosts' appearances just right for the biggest-possible wow factor. Over the course of the game-design process, the team was constantly working to balance the image-recognition technologies with the emotional impact of the overall experience. During the development process, they also realized just how much the experience hinged on sound. Enlisting the help of PlayStation\u00ae sound teams from Japan and overseas, the team designed background music and sound effects to help set the scene for players and lead them from location to location\u2014all to add another, invisible dimension to the realism of the experience. The process of setting the scene stretched beyond the AR and sound elements, too: the developers decided to have players don near-replicas of the jumpsuits from Ghostbusters before starting their journey to get the immersion element flowing right away. The players then headed into the game with \"guides\"-bona fide actors, not just staff members-leading the way with energetic flair around a meticulous rendering of the Ghostbusters world, full of sets and props that could have been pulled straight out of the movie. The AR glasses even featured network connectivity, a touch that gave both the experience and the technical side of the project a high-grade finish.\n\nThe team had to decide where and when ghosts were going to appear, so they went back and forth between the drawing board and testing setting to get the optimal overall balance.\n\n(L) An artist from the Ghostbusters comic book handled the visuals for the tutorial video; \n\n(R) Two participants take in the experience.* (Top) An artist from the Ghostbusters comic book handled the visuals for the tutorial video; \n\n(Bottom) Two participants take in the experience.*"
