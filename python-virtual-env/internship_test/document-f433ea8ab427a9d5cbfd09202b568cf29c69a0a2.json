   "content": "The smash-hit Men in Black franchise premiered its latest entry, Men in Black: International, on June 14. Decked out in black suits and sunglasses, the trademark look of the series, Men in Black (MIB) agents hit the silver screen for an action-packed, science-fiction romp.\n\nWhile the lead MIB agents policed aliens on Earth, a Sony designer helped shape the aesthetics of the movie by designing the agency members\u2019 high-tech pen projectors. The prop-design project for Men in Black: International is just another example of Sony designs featuring prominently in films by Sony Pictures Entertainment.\n\nThe set pieces you see in MIB films, things like watches and cars, all have a sleek, classic look. However, it\u2019s just a disguise for what the items really are: high-tech weapons and futuristic gadgets. That gap is what the MIB props are all about. When I started designing the pen projector, I focused on giving the item a standard, classical aesthetic that would make it totally unassuming at first glance. You\u2019d never expect such a mundane-looking pen to transform into a projection device."
