(NASDAQ: EA) today announced that the SimCity\u2122 Cities of Tomorrow* expansion pack is now available for PC and Mac at retail stores across North America and for digital download on Origin. SimCity Cities of Tomorrow offers the more than two million players worldwide the opportunity to futurize every aspect of their cities with the help of plausible future technologies, giving players an entirely new way to dream about their city of the future. New MegaTowers, new city specializations, new future technology and new transportation methods will transform the way that cities take shape and evolve.\n\n\u201cMegaTowers, futurization, and the battle between Green and Greed, these are the main foundations that drive an all-new experience in SimCity Cities of Tomorrow,\u201d said Patrick Buechner, General Manager, Maxis Emeryville. \u201cThis expansion pack completely transforms how you play as you tackle the problems of tomorrow using plausible future technologies. But that technology comes as a price \u2013 the clean utopian world of The Academy requires a wealthy workforce that demands a higher style of living. OmegaCo, while extremely profitable, will take its toll on your Sims as the factories devour your natural resources and spit them back out in the form of harmful pollution. There is a new level of challenge waiting for you as the world pushes you back harder than ever before. The city of the future awaits; how it takes shape is up to you.\u201d\n\nSimCity Cities of Tomorrow is an entirely new way to play the ultimate city-building simulation. Players have the choice to create a utopian society underpinned by clean technology under the auspices of The Academy, or encourage giant corporation OmegaCo to strip-mine natural resources and pollute in the name of making massive profits. These new specializations are set against the backdrop of the all-new MegaTowers, massive structures that players build high into the sky and dwarf the rest of the city. With the right balance the MegaTowers become self-sustaining monoliths that cater to all of the needs of the Sims under one roof. When players have finished deciding whether they want their Sims to live together in harmony, or as members of an exploited workforce, they can rain chaos upon them by unleashing an all-new disaster exclusive to this expansion pack.\n\nThe SimCity base game is available on PC and Mac and was developed by Maxis. The base game and expansion pack are cross-platform compatible, so all players play together across the same servers. Owners of SimCity Cities of Tomorrow can play alongside those who do not own the expansion pack and provide them with futurization benefits when they play together in the same region. Launched last March, SimCity has had eight major game updates that have made upgrades to the core simulation and provided game content at no additional cost.\n\nSimCity Cities of Tomorrow is now available in North America for PC and Mac and is rated E10+ by the ESRB.
