PopCap is launching the next title in the beloved Plants vs. Zombies\u2122 franchise with a whole new way to play ahead of launch.\n\nFeaturing over-the-top action that fans of previous Plants vs. Zombies shooter titles have come to know and love, players can jump down into Giddy Park for light multiplayer battles or use the social board to interact with other players and group up. Players will unravel the threats of three free-roam regions, including the familiar central location of Neighborville Town Center, as well as adventuring through the outer edges of Neighborville in the hot and dusty Mount Steep, and the lush and strange Weirding Woods regions.\n\nAt the core of Plants vs. Zombies: Battle for Neighborville is the game\u2019s emphasis on thrilling multiplayer gameplay. Players can battle it out with 20 fully customizable character classes, including returning favorites like Peashooter and Chomper, along with some fresh new faces such as Night Cap, a master of the shadows, and the funky disco queen Electric Slide. The character roster also includes a Team Play class for each faction, Oak and Acorn, and Space Cadet. Additionally, players can join forces and kick some grass in split screen couch co-op* and online co-op across every mode, whether it is battling through flourishing free-roam regions or jumping into battle in six different multiplayer modes. The fun doesn't stop there as players can then partake in Festivals after the game\u2019s October launch to unlock new seasonal rewards.\n\nFor those wanting to jump into the fun ahead of launch, Plants vs. Zombies: Battle for Neighborville Founder\u2019s Edition is available on PC via Origin\u2122, Xbox One, and PlayStation\u00ae4 consoles.
