So much so that it\u2019s been a while since we took a look at this site.\n\nWell, having expanded our paper collection, tested and introduced new processes, and spent a lot of time talking to designers about selecting paper, we\u2019re delighted to present a complete overhaul of the site.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, we\u2019ve introduced search filters in the \u2018We Recommend\u2019 tool. You can now refine your search by a paper\u2019s suitability for processes like foiling or digital printing, or its availability in certain weights and finishes. When it\u2019s time to look at the real thing, you\u2019re able to easily place Sample orders through our \u2018My Samples\u2019 tool. Its quick and easy too.\n\nThis makes the task of finding and choosing paper from our collection more insightful and easier than before."
