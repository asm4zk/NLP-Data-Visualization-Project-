The development project leader at Kyocera, which was spearheading the effort, was aiming for an engaging design\u2014and he specifically asked the Sony Creative Center to handle it.\n\nHosodaWhen I design a product, I always think about how I can make the user's life better. That's how I approached Possi. I wanted it to be something that'd make the whole family happy, basically. Parenting is an incredible experience, for sure, but it can be tiring, too. When you look at what goes into everyday family life, there are little things that can be real sources of stress. Brushing, for example, tends to be a chore for children. Getting kids to brush tends to be a chore for a lot of parents, too. But it's also a little chunk of together time\u2014and it's definitely a shame when that precious time together turns into a struggle. I eventually got around to thinking that we could turn brushing from a chore into a form of play. To make the process less frustrating, we could design Possi as a kind of cute, lifelike buddy. That's what got the ball rolling: soon enough, I was starting to design Possi like a creature of sorts, envisioning its brush as a tail.\n\nJoganoI was in charge of communication design. When Hosoda told me that he wanted to shape a cute worldview, an angle that'd help children get around their aversion to brushing, I totally knew where he was coming from. As a parent of a young child myself, I know how hard the whole process can be. Although I had an idea of the goal we were going for, creating a worldview is easier said than done; I had to think about how to build it, how to present it to the rest of the team, and how to convey the core message to users. The first thing I did was write a storybook with Possi as the main character. Seeing as how the musical element plays a big role in defining the product, I came up with a story about Possi using its singing voice to turn dastardly bacteria characters\u2014\"Bamushi\"\u2014into friends and, in the end, dance together. I ran with the idea and finished the whole book before the day was over.\n\nHosodaThe second I saw the book and started flipping through the pages, I knew the story was exactly what we needed. We brought the book along when we made our design proposal to Kyocera and Lion, using the narrative and the illustrations to capture our vision. After we finished, the response was great\u2014the people from Kyocera and Lion told us they'd been hoping for an entertainment element, an area that Sony really excels in. They were on board with the basic vision, and we already had the foundation for our communication approach\u2014the book. Jogano and I started working on translating the book into a more concrete plan for reaching families with small children.\n\nJoganoTo do that, we knew we had to make Possi something that'd appeal to the whole family\u2014adults and children alike. If we went with a conventional approach, creating video and website content with a focus on functional performance, we wouldn't be able to connect with everybody. We\u2019d lose the element of fun\u2014and a simple product showcase wouldn't get people talking about the product. As we thought about the best way to make an impact across the age spectrum, we got around to the idea of writing a theme song and shooting a music video. Who doesn't like a catchy tune and a cool video, right? We figured that approach would give us a better chance of getting children's and parents' attention. That initial interface was key. As long as we had a good hook, people would naturally develop an interest in the product, make their way to the website, and learn more.\n\nThe song was obviously going to be crucial, and we were lucky enough to find a great collaborator. Sony Music set us up with DJ Misosiru& MC Gohan, who\u2019s really popular with children (and me, incidentally). After we showed her the Possi book and officially requested a song, we didn't have to wait long for the results to come in. In just a few days, DJ Misosiru& MC Gohan came up with \"Possi and Eeahh\"\u2014a song that fit the whole Possi worldview to a tee, from the lyrics and the melody to the groove. That put us in position for the next step of the process: the theme song needed a music video."
