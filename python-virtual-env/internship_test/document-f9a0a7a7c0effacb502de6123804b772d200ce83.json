   "content": "Moschino and Maxis\u2122, a studio of Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) announced that Jeremy Scott will host his annual Palm Springs Desert Party with The Sims\u2122 to celebrate the launch of a new capsule collection. Inspired by the popular life simulation video game franchise, a whole collection of ready-to-wear items and accessories including Moschino items with pixelated designs and a limited run of eight Moschino x The Sims items will be available at Moschino boutiques worldwide as well as Moschino.com on April 13th.\n\nThe Sims and Moschino collaboration is exciting for fans of both brands as it brings together two industry leaders both known for a celebration of individuality. This capsule collection will feature iconic motifs from The Sims reimagined as Moschino Couture pieces such as a Plumbob bathing suit, a Freezer Bunny cell phone cover and a Uni-Lama T-shirt. These special items highlight the freedom of self-expression and creativity that both the Moschino brand and The Sims franchise are known for. One item from the capsule collection, a Freezer Bunny hoodie, will also be released after the event within all of The Sims current titles including The Sims 4, The Sims Mobile and The Sims FreePlay with more game-related announcements to come later this year.\n\n\u201cI love the idea of being able to imagine, design and bring to life a world of individual personas with The Sims universe,\u201d said Jeremy Scott, Creative Director of Moschino. \u201cThat concept emulates what I get to do for each collection at Moschino as I create a fantasy universe of spectacular storylines and characters.\u201d\n\nCelebrating nearly 20 years of endless possibilities to play with life, The Sims has brought players the power to express themselves through video games in a way that is most authentic and meaningful to them. Through unique avatar Sims they create, players control everything from hairstyles, skin tones and outfits, to Sim\u2019s homes, hobbies, and career aspirations across vibrant environments. In The Sims 4, players have the power to create and control their Sims in a virtual world where there are no rules. The Sims 4 is available on the PlayStation\u00ae4 computer entertainment system, Xbox One all-in-one games and entertainment system from Microsoft and PC via Origin\u2122. For players on the go, both The Sims Mobile and The Sims FreePlay are available for free* on iOS and Android platforms.\n\nTo join The Sims conversation, please like The Sims on Facebook, follow on Twitter and Instagram or subscribe to the YouTube channel.
