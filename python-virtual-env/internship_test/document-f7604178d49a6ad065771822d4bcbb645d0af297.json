   "content": "A new tool for the written word\n\nPaper plays a big role in certain occupations. If you\u2019re a professor, doctor, or lawyer, for example, you\u2019re always carrying around piles of documents, reading articles, and jotting down notes. Imagine if you could transform that paper experience with a digital tool, one that not only replicated reading and writing text on paper but also gave you a single electronic device to store all your documents in one place. That\u2019s what Sony designers were after with DPT-RP1\u2014a tool that would make paper-heavy tasks more efficient and help people go paperless. As we got going on the project, we did field research in our target users\u2019 work environments. That gave us what we needed to start drawing up a practical tool for the digital age.\n\nOur investigations showed us what makes paper such a great medium: It\u2019s easy on the eyes, easy to read, and easy to take quick notes on. Most offices these days are already brimming with new, multifunctional technology like computers and tablets, which give professionals fast, convenient tools to read and write with. Despite the advantages that all those high-performance devices provide, though, there were still quite a few people who preferred the traditional paper format. For them, there were too many drawbacks\u2014the eye strain of looking at an LCD screen or the clumsy, often limited pen features of the latest tablets, for example, just made for an unpleasant experience. The attachment to the pen-and-paper style wasn\u2019t just about ease and familiarity, either: We saw how the sound and feel of the pen actually meeting the paper lit a creative spark in people, making the writing process more productive. With that, we narrowed our focus to reading and writing functions and set out to develop DPT-RP1 around the kind of smooth readability and tactile pleasure of writing that other digital devices can\u2019t deliver."
