   "content": "Can you tell us a bit about the Warp Square project?\n\nOgura (project leader) : Our basic mission is to research and develop a format for showcasing interactive content, which means formulating the whole concept for an interactive booth and then creating original content to go in it. The team's role in the Warp Square project only goes as far as content development, but the initiative is kind of an extension of the interactive CUBE_1 space that Sony Design created from scratch at ISETAN The Japan Store Kuala Lumpur and opened in October 2016.\n\nThe Warp Square is a space that uses ultra-short-throw projectors to cast interactive, high-definition imagery on the four walls of a room with a floor area of around 20 square meters, letting multiple users share immersive audiovisual experiences. The goal was new value for interactive content, which meant that we had to be as original as possible. That's why we chose to create four surface-specific displays instead of operating within the more common framework of full 360-degree projection.\n\nOhki (designer) : At Sony, you see a lot of technologies that seem so cool and innovative\u2014but you can't tell exactly what they're supposed to do or how you're supposed to use them. That's where in-house designers can be a real asset. We can go in, talk with the engineers, come up with new concepts and user-friendly operations that the engineering team hasn't thought of, and start infusing the technologies with fresh, innovative value. For me, personally, that's where in-house designers make a difference.\n\nOur first thinking in creating the contents was how to take advantage of corners and edges of flat walls. The idea that we came up with was to create a discontinuous content with a continuous feel."
