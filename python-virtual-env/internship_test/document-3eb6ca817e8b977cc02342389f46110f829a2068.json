   "content": "TV screens keep getting bigger. Living spaces need to be places of comfort and ease. The Slice of Living concept tries to find equilibrium in that context, seeking a harmonious balance between home products and living rooms. The idea behind this new home product design was simple: If you took all the elements, materials, and basic manners that have always been part of the \u201cliving room\u201d ideal, sliced them into individual pieces, and reconstructed them in new ways, you might be able to find arrangements where the living room components and products struck more harmonious chords.\n\nRunning with that idea, designers started sampling virtually anything they could find in living spaces\u2014from the silhouettes of chairs and other furniture, wall materials, and tiling patterns to textures like fabric and leather. Reconfiguring products with those samples and the tools of furniture and architecture helped the team carve out an innovative home product approach, one where items not only chimed with their surroundings but also helped style spaces in their own right."
