To make that happen, we needed to fill our design with features and details that'd stimulate kids\u2014things to spark their curiosity, get their brains hungry for deeper knowledge, and stretch their imaginations.\n\nMiyake: Making the blocks transparent and colorful was part of that. Plain, solid-color blocks wouldn't have been the right approach. We opted for a transparent design because it made the holes on the blocks less conspicuous, giving the models a cleaner, neater look. When we put the transparent design together with a bright, varied color scheme, we saw how we could add another fun dimension to the user experience: color combinations. If you put a yellow block in front of a blue block, for example, you get green. KOOV isn't just about learning how to program robots. It gives kids a cool, exciting way to discover new colors and let their imaginations run even wilder\u2014and it's all as simple as playing with building blocks.\n\nIshida: We also wanted KOOV to hold people's interest for the long haul, which meant that we had to come up with visual hooks that'd foster a stronger attachment to the product. That got us thinking about how to give the animal models more personality\u2014basically, we wanted the models to be characters that kids could recognize and connect with.\n\nMiyake: We concentrated on the eyes, which play a big role in shaping a character's identity. Eye size and eye location have a big impact on how people perceive a given character. I really doubt many people in the educational materials industry pay as much attention to little design details as the designers on the KOOV project did, but we knew that being meticulous with the tiniest details would give the end result a stronger pull. That kind of care resonates with people, even kids, so we poured lots of time and energy into designing eyes with a lovable look, experimenting with different sizes and luster levels until we got what we were looking for.\n\nIshida: Our efforts paid off\u2014the response was great. We took the animal models to international exhibitions, where kids from all over the world got the chance to try the blocks out. You should\u2019ve seen the twinkles in their eyes; it was incredible how enthusiastic they all were. At our programming workshops in Japan, some kids would pump their fists in the air every time the models moved\u2014some even got so engrossed in the KOOV experience that they just couldn\u2019t stop playing. When we saw all those smiles, we knew that we'd done the design right.\n\n\u2014 The app interface was another part of the design process. What sorts of ideas and elements did you bring into the app UI?\n\nTamura: For the new UI, a unique KOOV interface, we focused on giving first-time users a smooth, intuitive pathway into programming. Knowing that we'd have to establish a unified KOOV worldview that would extend from the blocks through to the app, we built the UI design around the block aesthetic\u2014not only did we align the UI colors with the block colors, but we also gave the button look a solid, block-like presence to make the programming operations feel just like the block-building process. The overall visual simplicity, I think, makes the actual coding seem much less challenging.\n\nAnother element in making the learning curve as smooth and enjoyable as possible is the map feature, which places kids' block creations in a virtual community. As new creations make their way onto the map, the community gets bigger, busier, and more diverse\u2014and seeing that growth makes kids more excited about making more robots. We also developed different community types for different age groups, ensuring that older users would have access to communities that suited their tastes, too. Community design is another area where we can really tap into our creativity: We've even made maps for a city in the sky and a cool artist enclave."
