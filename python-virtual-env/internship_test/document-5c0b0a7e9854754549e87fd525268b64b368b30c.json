   "content": "At the Asama International Photo Festival 2019 PHOTO MIYOTA (Miyota-machi, Kitasaku-gun, Nagano), a festival where attendees enjoy artistic photography, Sony Design will display \"YOU and BAU,\" an experience-oriented exhibit produced in collaboration with photographer Takashi Suzuki.\n\nYOU and BAU is a new kind of photo experience that inserts festival attendees into \"BAU,\" Mr. Suzuki's photo artwork, by fusing technology and design. Attendees can enjoy the exhibit however they like, such as sitting on the sponges used in the artwork or reclining on them. Those photo situations can be printed and taken home as keepsakes. \n\n This exhibit was made possible by applying the Chromakey-less CG overlay feature of the Edge Analytics Appliance, a video production support unit equipped with Sony's unique video analysis technology.\n\n Sony Design supports the aim of the Asama International Photo Festival 2019 PHOTO MIYOTA to \"attempt new possibilities for photography,\" and offers new ways for people to enjoy photos."
