   "content": "A shape that fits comfortably in your hand. This basic premise took OmniBalance design a step further in the Xperia Z1. There are as many ways to hold smartphones as there are users and usage scenarios\u2014vertically, horizontally, one-handed, or with both hands. The trick was to find a shape that\u2019s comfortable no matter how you hold it. Spheres are rather free shapes without directionality and feel the same no matter how they\u2019re held. We wondered how to translate these qualities of balls into something quite different\u2014the block-like shape of a phone.\n\nOn the Xperia Z1, the four corners of the metal frame, which is carved out from a bar of aluminum, recreate perfect spheres. Fabrication requires precision on the level of hundredths of a millimeter. As if that were not difficult enough, the corners gradually merge with sides cut perfectly flat. This produces a bar with spherical qualities along the edges and in the corners, which come into contact with your hand. These precise semicircles where the flat sides meet the four corners show the overall build quality. Incorporating roundness in Xperia Z1 design was both practical\u2014because it\u2019s more comfortable\u2014and iconic."
