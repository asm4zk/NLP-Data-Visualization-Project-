   "content": "Japanese electrical appliances are part of our daily lives in Sri Lanka, where I was born and raised. I was particularly familiar with the Sony brand and fond of Sony radios and TVs from my childhood. I was good at scientific subjects and was very keen to study at a university in Japan, which is very strong in engineering and has extremely high technological capabilities. However, tuition fees are higher than in my home country, and since I did not want to be a burden on my parents, I gave up the idea. Around that time, I learned about the scholarship schemes offered by Japan's Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), and decided to apply. The selection procedure was extremely strict with only 2-3 people selected out of the 60 or so people who passed the documentary screening. Fortunately, I managed to get through and came to Japan to study.\n\nI majored in electrical engineering and did research into optical engineering. My interest in working at Sony was triggered when I took up an internship there as part of the third-year curriculum. I chose Sony out of several companies both because I had admired it since my childhood and because the internship lasted around one month, longer than the internships at other companies. I thought this would give me more time to properly observe the corporate culture and workplace atmosphere at the company. I was uneasy at first, but once I started, I found my workplace colleagues were energetic and happy in their work, creating a truly warm atmosphere. As I spoke about various things with my senior colleagues, my determination to work at Sony grew steadily stronger. While I had the option of going to graduate school after I graduated from university, I decided to seek employment at Sony because I believed it would enable me to grow through the greater experience I would gain from working there. I also thought I would become better able to contribute to the world by making the most of my capabilities."
