Thanks to the recently adopted improvements, CONMEBOL tournaments last year achieved record numbers in digital participation, stadium attendance and sales.\n\nElectronic Arts (NASDAQ: EA) is a global leader in digital interactive entertainment. The Company develops and delivers games, content and online services for Internet-connected consoles, mobile devices and personal computers.\n\nIn fiscal year 2019, EA posted GAAP net revenue of $4.95 billion.
