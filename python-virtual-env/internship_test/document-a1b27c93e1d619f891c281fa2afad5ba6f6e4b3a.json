   "content": "The basic concept behind the earcuffs was clear from the beginning. The design? Not so much. The original idea, according to the team, wasn\u2019t even remotely close to what they ended up with in the end. How did they manage to navigate and steer that evolutionary process?\n\nMihara: Hosoda\u2019s original prototype didn\u2019t look anything like earphones at first glance\u2014it was a fresh take, a modern spin on the standard design approach. We were all gung ho about it. We headed off to the United States and field-tested the prototype around San Francisco, asking people around town and college campuses to get their thoughts. The reactions, though, caught us off guard. People loved the look of the design, but it might\u2019ve been too innovative for its own good\u2014the form and the fit were so new and unfamiliar that the testers couldn\u2019t figure out how to place the device correctly on their ears. Not too many people seemed really enthusiastic about the idea of actually owning and using it, either, so we had to find a way to connect the product with lifestyles.\n\nHosoda: Looking back at that first design, I think we were leaning too hard on the functional side: The \u201cout-of-ear\u201d idea was pretty much the only dimension. We needed to shift the focus\u2014it was all about how people engaged with music at a more basic level. We headed back out and watched people walking the streets, thinking of what their personal soundtracks might sound like. We hit the beach, sat down, and watched a woman strolling on the sand. \u201cWhat do you think she\u2019d want to hear,\u201d we asked ourselves, \u201cagainst the sound of the waves?\u201d As we tried to imagine a clearer vision of the music dynamic in people\u2019s lifestyles, I started to render that hidden story\u2014that narrative weaving the user and the product together\u2014in a more concrete, visual shape.\n\nTagami: With Hosoda\u2019s insight into our target persona, the ideal design gradually came into focus. We eventually gave the idea a name\u2014\u201csound earcuffs\u201d\u2014that helped establish differentiation from traditional earbuds, form the product\u2019s identity as a platform for \u201cnew experiences,\u201d and even lay the groundwork for a promotional strategy.\n\nHosoda: We\u2019re a startup, so there was a real ambitious, \u201cdo-it-ourselves\u201d mentality running through the project. We were the ones who did the field tests in San Francisco; we were the ones doing the designing. Without that tight, responsive teamwork, I don\u2019t think we would\u2019ve been able to come up with such a new, compelling design. The immediacy of everything we did\u2014talking directly with potential customers, getting a firsthand feel for trends, and actually hearing about the experiences and lifestyles that people wanted\u2014paid huge dividends. We translated all that input back into the idea as soon as it came in, putting us on the fast track to the earcuffs that we\u2019ve got here today."
