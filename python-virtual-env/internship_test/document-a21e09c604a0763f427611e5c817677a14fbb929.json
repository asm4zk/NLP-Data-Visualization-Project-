   "content": "Approaching new design for a global market began with fieldwork in London. Home to many in the music industry, this cosmopolitan city is where much music enjoyed worldwide originates. Several streaming services are available, and the music creators and avid listeners here continue to shape audio trends. London set the scene for designers from Europe, Tokyo, and Shanghai to meet and collaborate with others in acoustic and mechanical design and product planning. Through a series of discussions, the designers considered their approach.\n\nIn the field, the designers also met frequently with design-savvy consumers and music industry professionals. Reexamining some rough design ideas through the lens of keywords from these talks would surely yield insight\u2014hopefully, in a pure and simple form. One compelling concept that emerged was speakers that blend in. Not assertive design, but understated design that blends harmoniously into rooms; quiet and composed. By expertly erasing all traces of typical electronics, we would reveal iconic design."
