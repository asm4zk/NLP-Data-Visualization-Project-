   "content": "To create a new product, a team needs process for sharing a vision and turning it into reality. While the engineers were giving shape to the RX0, then, the communication designers were creating a video to depict the new forms of visual expression that the RX0 would unlock.\n\n What the video did was unify the overall vision; it gave the planning, engineering, and design segments an actual visualization of what they were trying to accomplish. That laid the foundation for dynamic synergy, with the different groups fusing their expertise into a single product.\n\nThat initial visualization process would prove instrumental in imbuing the overall communication design, of course, as well as the product catalog, website, event displays, and everything else, with a consistent concept. \n\n The catalog, which presents a moving, dynamic subject in a single still frame bursting with vitality, showcases the versatility of the multi-angle approach. At IFA, the world's largest consumer electronics trade show, the core elements of the team's communication design shined through to reflect the quality of the camera\u2014and the story informing its overall worldview\u2014by using 26 75-inch monitors to represent the unique visual diversity of the multi-camera setup."
