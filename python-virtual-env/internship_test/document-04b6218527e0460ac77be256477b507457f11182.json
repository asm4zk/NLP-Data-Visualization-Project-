The main focus tends to be on finished products, obviously, so I usually try to design spatial information in a simple, neutral style that lets the products take center stage.\n\nSXSW marked a departure from that basic approach. Instead of featuring products that were ready for market, Sony wanted to showcase pipeline projects and prototypes using technologies that were still in development. The standard, business-based product exhibition format that you normally see at corporate events wouldn't work, then\u2014we needed to create a space that'd allow attendees to experience Sony's creativity, get a taste of the company's cutting-edge technologies, and open their eyes to future possibilities. Basically, it was all about linking the experiences to real life. To offer captivating experiences that people could make their own and imagine as enjoyable, fun-filled parts of their day-to-day existence, not just momentary glimpses of cool technology, our booth had to capture people's imaginations. Suzuki helped us fill out that vision on the graphics side.\n\nSuzuki(designer) : The WOW Factory project was actually my first time working on space design\u2014I'd never even drawn out a floor plan. Heading in as a first-timer, I wasn't really concentrating on profiling specific technologies in a deep, profound way. My focus was more on using colors and graphics to inspire the fun and wow-worthy aspects of the experience.\n\nWhen we got to thinking about how to showcase technologies that customers hadn't ever seen before, Kita came up with a great idea: the \"cell\" concept. As people encountered new, fun technologies, he said, their imaginations would get active and start to venture in new directions\u2014like cells growing and expanding into fuller wholes. The visuals I ended up creating built around that basic design concept, with solid-color \"cells\" representing new, formless technologies and joining together to create polygons. Graphic designs normally put the products front and center, but The WOW Factory forced me to think outside that box. I had to find a way of emphasizing things without any clear-cut shapes. For me, it was a really rewarding experience."
