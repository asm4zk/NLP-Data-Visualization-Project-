   "content": "Maesaka: Branding is another important part of getting customers to understand what a product all about\u2014and if our team didn\u2019t have a shared awareness of the core philosophy behind the WALLET card, the target audience would end up getting a different picture of the concept. To solidify the basic themes we were working with, we made a brand booklet that laid out the user experience and the underlying story in a visual format.\n\nIshii: The brand booklet was a huge factor\u2014it spoke directly to people who weren\u2019t involved in the design process, gave them a clear idea of the story, established the conceptual stance, and played a big role in building a consensus at Sony Bank. The persona and the customer experience only had vague outlines and contours until we laid eyes on the booklet, which pulled everything together with a visual clarity that made it easy to see exactly where we needed to head with the project. It brought the card to a more personal level\u2014all the people on project team started looking at the service in terms of what they\u2019d do if they were the users. It was amazing to see the business really start accelerating after the branding took shape.\n\nMaesaka: Visualizing things from the customer perspective is what we do. It\u2019s really gratifying to know that the ideas we came up with on the visual side made a difference on the business side of things, too.\n\nIshii: There are two basic dimensions of developing and releasing a new product: the abstract side, where you plan the business out in conceptual terms, and the concrete side, where you get specific about actual design elements. The thing that really made the WALLET collaboration a success was how the team managed to go back and forth between the two dimensions, always working to keep the two sides locked together and making sure that we always kept the bigger picture\u2014the provider perspective and the customer standpoint\u2014in mind. Good business isn\u2019t a one-or-the-other thing; you need both elements if you want to succeed. The project got us to go back to our roots, look at things with fresh eyes, and take an approach to business from the customer perspective."
