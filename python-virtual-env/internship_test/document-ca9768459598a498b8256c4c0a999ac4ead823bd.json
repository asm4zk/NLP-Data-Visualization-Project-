   "content": "Casual MP3 or AAC listening is now very common, fueled by the rise of smartphones and mobile devices, as fewer seek out the fidelity of high-resolution audio. We want more people to hear what they\u2019ve been missing, in listening experiences that leave CDs behind \u2013 especially now that advances in digital audio have turned up the quantity and quality in streaming and distribution. Meanwhile, the fact that wireless listening is more popular shows that people also crave simplicity and convenience. The time was right to take a fresh look at what makes premium audio premium and develop a new design language for today and tomorrow, to convey what sets this listening experience apart.\n\nWhat do people look for in premium audio design? We asked audio professionals and audiophiles through research and workshops in Tokyo and London. Revisiting audiophile aesthetics reminded us how important it is to reassure listeners about audio excellence, show its technical basis, and suggest high resolution through product appearance and materials. Rather than looking slim, light and futuristic, the superior product design we sought would inspire confidence by being solid and substantial."
