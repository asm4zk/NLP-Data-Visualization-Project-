   "content": "While being gently swayed by a Kotoden train car, I felt Manabe's close proximity to customers when speaking with him. This aspect is present across all of Kotoden\u2014whether it is at the station with a beer pub, another with bookshelves, posters on rider etiquette, or even for a collaborative poster to promote the Busshozan Onsen (hot springs) along the train line. All were carefully conceptualized with a sense of humor, or a dose of the unexpected. This was done not for the purpose of making Kotoden look cool, but rather to get closer to customers. Kotoden is a part of the community fabric because it sees things at the same level as the locals do. This relaxed, unpretentious style of communication was my biggest takeaway.\n\nI hear that Manabe participates in local events and parties as much as he can, and makes efforts to speak with people from all walks of life. It is exactly in these types of situations where he can get genuine feedback from customers, and come into direct contact with their values. I believe he got his ideas through his regular, pro-active communication efforts that gave birth to relationships both inside and outside the company."
