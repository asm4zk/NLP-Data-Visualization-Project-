   "content": "Hoping to provide emotionally moving experiences, Sony has dramatically reshaped its approach to event design. How do designers go about creating interfaces that deliver the Sony brand experience?\n\nKondo: In years past, Sony's booths were like showrooms for highlighting the designs and features of individual products. They were clean and chic, but they tended to be pretty inorganic\u2014kind of cold\u2014in their presentation. From our perspective, we had to go in a different direction. Returning to the Sony mission of moving customers emotionally and inspiring their curiosity at the \"last one inch,\" we knew that our booth touchpoints needed to deliver inspiring experiences with the power to reach people on an immediate, emotional wavelength. New experiences and new surprises would form those visceral gateways, ushering visitors into a deeper sense of what the Sony brand stands for. That was the basic approach we took in creating the booth, and the process really hinged on forging a design that could awaken an emotional response.\n\nKita: Sony's event designs aren't the only things that have been shifting from functionality to experience\u2014customer needs are trending in the same direction. Quality experiences, then, are vital. After the IFA project brought us designers on board, we all decided to move past the conventional focus on product features and get to work on building the exhibit around the \"experience\" concept. Working with Schmidhuber, our agent in Germany, we started thinking up ways to add a suggestive dimension to the design: hints that would give people ideas of how products would fit into spaces, what kinds of roles products would play in everyday life, and how products would align with different lifestyles. Basically, we were aiming for a comfortable, engaging experience in a welcoming environment, a place where people could imagine themselves using the products we were showcasing. Maximizing comfort meant foregrounding a relaxed, casual feel, so we went with wood and other organic materials to give visitors a relaxing environment to experience the products in.\n\nMitsugi: We had to make the message clear, too. Sony has so much audio and video content to offer, including a wide array of products along those lines, but trying to give all those different elements equal exposure and let every different product speak for itself would garble the overall message\u2014we'd be spreading the Sony brand too thin. We needed to outline a clear, unified direction for the event as a whole. For starters, we reworked the product information from a flood of category-by-category details into a simpler configuration that would jell with the overall design motifs. That got us on the way to establishing a clear message for the brand, one that visitors could understand without having to wade through competing information sources."
