   "content": "Knowing that the event would draw crowds from the world over, the development team had to take its prototype to the next level and make the experience even more captivating. For the team, the focus eventually centered on going past just recreating real sensations. By integrating the acoustic technologies with tactile technologies, the designers figured, they could transcend replication and create an entertainment experience in a completely new sensory mold. The concept was set; next came the motif. Inspiration came from a cave-space music festival that was taking place in Texas, where the SXSW event convenes. With that, the team set out to craft the experience of playing music with others within the depths of a dark cave.\n\nUtilizing hearing and touch to create a sensory \n\nawakening for a farther-reaching audience\n\nOnce the concept and motif were in place, the designers got into the concrete tasks of designing the actual experience of an in-cave concert. First came the physical setting, a space that would capture the darkness of a cave entirely isolated from external light and sound. The team also started thinking of ideas for the instrumental component, eventually settling on a setup where eventgoers would play bongos together. Serving as the backdrop for the real-life sounds of the playable bongo percussion were a profusion of virtual echoes, bat sounds, and other ambient noise, forming an immersive environment\u2014a convincingly cave-esque atmosphere without any visual cues whatsoever. The team also decided to situate visitors on platforms that would vibrate with the sounds of the bongos. As the rhythmic pulses expanded, with the sounds of over 100 bongo players making their way into the sound collage, the aural excitement and physical, tactile movement would fuse into a dynamic entertainment experience defying the bounds of everyday reality.\n\nTo make sure that the wonder of the CAVE without a LIGHT experience would be accessible to as many people as possible, the designers opted for an inclusive design approach. Reaching out to a broad range of Sony employees\u2014people with disabilities and people from different nationalities, for example\u2014the team gained a deeper understanding of different perspectives and used the insights to enrich and broaden the exhibit's appeal. Not only did that input help enhance usability, but it also elevated the quality of the entire experience. Take the 2.5-D cave model, for instance. Created to improve accessibility for people with visual impairments, the model also proved to be a helpful tool in helping speakers of different languages understand the whole experience better. The same goes for the exhibit's simple, straightforward music. Not only did the easy rhythms help people with physical disabilities play along, but the uncomplicated accompaniment made it easier to engage with the experience for visitors across the board. Going the other way, certain design features turned out to have a positive impact on the accessibility side: the designers turned the platforms diagonally to prevent the soundwaves from visitors' voices and bongo hits from bouncing off the walls, a tweak that also improved wheelchair access to the platforms.\n\n When you look around the designs filling the venue space, you can see how dedicated the team was to making the exhibit enjoyable for everyone\u2014regardless of ability or disability."
