   "content": "Envisioning a world in which intelligence, technology and creative design are more integrated. \n\n We believe that the relationship between humans and technology will evolve, \n\n through deeper understanding of Artificial Intelligence and its ability to display feelings. \n\n Affinity in Autonomy represents thoughts on the future of AI and Robotics.\n\nTranslating innovation into perceptual experiences is the theme for Sony Design's creation of this interactive robotic pendulum. The independence and free-will of robotics is portrayed by its random movements. \n\n Human presence can be detected and recognition appears from within the kinetic motion.\n\n Exhibiting a rich, dynamic and autonomous behavior, 'pendulus' engages by seeking an emotional and physical response. This conceptual piece endeavours to portray emotion and sensitivity, \n\n illustrating the enriched relationship possibilities for a new tomorrow.\n\n\n\n 'The Prince Consort Gallery' at the Victoria and Albert Museum, \n\n provides a magnificent context for this experience."
